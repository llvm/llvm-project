[section:c_sharp Using the Distributions from Within C#]

The distributions in this library can be used from the C# programming language
when they are built using Microsoft's Common Language Runtime (CLR) option.

An example of this kind of usage is given in the
[@../distexplorer/html/index.html Distribution Explorer]
example.  See =boost-root/libs/math/dot_net_example=
for the source code: the application consists of a C++ .dll that contains the
actual distributions, and a C# GUI that allows you to explore their properties.
