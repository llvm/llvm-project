[h4 Synopsis]

``
#include <boost/math/special_functions/gamma.hpp>
``

   namespace boost{ namespace math{ 
   
   template <class T1, class T2>
   BOOST_MATH_GPU_ENABLED ``__sf_result`` gamma_p_derivative(T1 a, T2 x);
   
   template <class T1, class T2, class ``__Policy``>
   BOOST_MATH_GPU_ENABLED ``__sf_result`` gamma_p_derivative(T1 a, T2 x, const ``__Policy``&);
   
   }} // namespaces
   
[h4 Description]

This function find some uses in statistical distributions: it
implements the partial derivative with respect to /x/ of the incomplete
gamma function.

[equation derivative1]

[optional_policy]

Note that the derivative of the function __gamma_q can be obtained by negating
the result of this function.

The return type of this function is computed using the __arg_promotion_rules
when T1 and T2 are different types, otherwise the return type is simply T1.

[h4 Accuracy]

Almost identical to the incomplete gamma function __gamma_p: refer to
the documentation for that function for more information.

[h4 Implementation]

This function just expose some of the internals of the incomplete
gamma function __gamma_p: refer to the documentation for that function
for more information.
