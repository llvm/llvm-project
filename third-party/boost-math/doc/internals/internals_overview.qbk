[section:internals_overview Overview]

This section contains internal utilities used by the library's implementation
along with tools used in development and testing.  These tools have
limitied documentation, but now have quite stable interfaces
and may also be useful outside Boost.Math.

There is no doubt that these components can be improved, but they are also
largely incidental to the main purpose of this library.

These tools are designed to "just get the job done", and receive minimal
documentation here, in the hopes that they will help stimulate further
submissions to this library.
