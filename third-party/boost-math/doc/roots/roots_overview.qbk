Several tools are provided to aid finding minima and roots of functions.

Some  __root_finding_without_derivatives methods are __bisection,
__bracket_solve, including use of __root_finding_TOMS748.

For __root_finding_with_derivatives the methods of
__newton, __halley, and __schroder are implemented.

For locating minima of a function,  a __brent_minima_example is provided.

There are several fully-worked __root_finding_examples, including:

* __root_finding_example_cbrt_without_derivatives
* __root_finding_example_cbrt_with_1_derivative
* __root_finding_example_cbrt_with_2_derivatives
