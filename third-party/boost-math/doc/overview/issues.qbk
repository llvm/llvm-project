[section:issues Known Issues, and TODO List]

Predominantly this is a TODO list, or a list of possible
future enhancements.  Items labeled "High Priority" effect
the proper functioning of the component, and should be fixed
as soon as possible.  Items labeled "Medium Priority" are
desirable enhancements, often pertaining to the performance
of the component, but do not effect it's accuracy or functionality.
Items labeled "Low Priority" should probably be investigated at
some point.  Such classifications are obviously highly subjective.

If you don't see a component listed here, then we don't have any known
issues with it.

[h4 tgamma]

* Can the __lanczos be optimized any further?  (low priority)

[h4 Incomplete Beta]

* Investigate Didonato and Morris' asymptotic expansion for large a and b
(medium priority).

[h4 Inverse Gamma]

* Investigate whether we can skip iteration altogether if the first approximation
is good enough (Medium Priority).

[h4 Polynomials]

* The Legendre and Laguerre Polynomials have surprisingly different error
rates on different platforms, considering they are evaluated with only
basic arithmetic operations.  Maybe this is telling us something, or maybe not
(Low Priority).

[h4 Elliptic Integrals]

* [para Carlson's algorithms (mainly R[sub J]) are somewhat prone to
internal overflow/underflow when the arguments are very large or small.
The homogeneity relations:]
[para R[sub F](ka, kb, kc) = k[super -1/2] R[sub F](a, b, c)]
[para and]
[para R[sub J](ka, kb, kc, kr) = k[super -3/2] R[sub J](a, b, c, r)]
[para could be used to sidestep trouble here: provided the problem domains
can be accurately identified. (Medium Priority).]
* There are a several other integrals: Bulirsch's ['el] functions that could
be implemented using Carlson's integrals (Low Priority).
* The integrals K(k) and E(k) could be implemented using rational
approximations (both for efficiency and accuracy),
assuming we can find them. (Medium Priority).

[h4 Owen's T Function]

There is a problem area at arbitrary precision when ['a] is very close to 1.  However, note that
the value for ['T(h, 1)] is well known and easy to compute, and if we replaced the
['a[super k]] terms in series T1, T2 or T4 by ['(a[super k] - 1)] then we would have the
difference between ['T(h, a)] and ['T(h, 1)].  Unfortunately this doesn't improve the
convergence of those series in that area.  It certainly looks as though a new series in terms
of ['(1-a)[super k]] is both possible and desirable in this area, but it remains elusive at present.

[h4 Statistical distributions]

* Student's t Perhaps switch to normal distribution
as a better approximation for very large degrees of freedom?

[h4 Feature Requests]

The following table lists distributions that are found in other packages
but which are not yet present here, the more frequently the distribution
is found, the higher the priority for implementing it:

]

Also asked for more than once:

* Add support for interpolated distributions, possibly combine with numeric
integration and differentiation.
* Add support for bivariate and multivariate distributions: most especially the normal.
* Add support for the log of the cdf and pdf:
this is mainly a performance optimisation since we can avoid
some special function calls for some distributions
by returning the log of the result.
