[section:standalone Standalone Usage]

This library is able to be used completely standalone - which is to say without any of the rest of the Boost libraries present on your system.  
In order to do this you must either:

* Be using a compiler which supports `__has_include()` in which case the presence or absence of the other Boost libraries is determined automatically, and/or:
* Define `BOOST_MATH_STANDALONE` on the compiler command line.  This will force the library into standalone mode even when other Boost headers are present.

Note that once the library is in standalone mode, you must have a conforming C++11 compiler as no allowances will be made for possible compiler defects
which would otherwise be detected by Boost.Config.  In addition, if you use a section of the library which makes (possibly optional) use of features from
later C++ standards, then support for that later standard version becomes pretty much mandatory.  In other words, if you hit issues, try upping your compiler's
conformance level to C++17 if you can.
