# /etc/nscd.conf
#
# An example Name Service Cache config file.  This file is needed by nscd.
#
# WARNING: Running nscd with a secondary caching service like sssd may lead to
#          unexpected behaviour, especially with how long entries are cached.
#
# Legal entries are:
#
#	logfile			<file>
#	debug-level		<level>
#	threads			<initial #threads to use>
#	max-threads		<maximum #threads to use>
#	server-user             <user to run server as instead of root>
#		server-user is ignored if nscd is started with -S parameters
#       stat-user               <user who is allowed to request statistics>
#	reload-count		unlimited|<number>
#	paranoia		<yes|no>
#	restart-interval	<time in seconds>
#
#       enable-cache		<service> <yes|no>
#	positive-time-to-live	<service> <time in seconds>
#	negative-time-to-live   <service> <time in seconds>
#       suggested-size		<service> <prime number>
#	check-files		<service> <yes|no>
#	persistent		<service> <yes|no>
#	shared			<service> <yes|no>
#	NOTE: Setting 'shared' to a value of 'yes' will accelerate the lookup,
#	      but those lookups will not be counted as cache hits
#	      i.e. 'nscd -g' may show '0%'.
#	max-db-size		<service> <number bytes>
#	auto-propagate		<service> <yes|no>
#
# Currently supported cache names (services): passwd, group, hosts, services
