/* This header is expected to define a few particular macros.

   The traditional BSD macros that correspond directly to POSIX <limits.h>
   macros don't need to be defined here if <bits/local_lim.h> defines the
   POSIX limit macro, as the common <sys/param.h> code will define each
   traditional name to its POSIX name if available.

   This file should define at least:
