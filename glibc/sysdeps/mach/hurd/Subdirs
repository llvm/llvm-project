# This file says that the hurd subdirectory should appear before all others.
# The mach and hurd subdirectories have many generated header files which
# much of the rest of the library depends on, so it is best to build them
# first (and mach before hurd, at that).  The before-compile additions in
# sysdeps/{mach,hurd}/Makefile should make it reliably work for these files
# not to exist when making in other directories, but it will be slower that
# way with more somewhat expensive `make' invocations.
