# This tests the common-case scenario for pthread_once.
# We have a single thread that runs a no-op initialization once and then
# repeatedly runs checks of the initialization (i.e., an acquire load and
# conditional jump) in a tight loop.
# scripts/bench.py doesn't handle function pointers, so we just use void *:
