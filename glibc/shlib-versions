# This file (and shlib-versions files in sysdeps directories) defines
# the shared library version numbers we will install.

# The following lines list the associated versions to use for various
# libraries.  The entire list is processed, with earlier entries
# taking precedence over later entries (and the files from sysdeps
# directories coming before those from other subdirectories, which
# come before this file).

# This file can use cpp-style conditionals starting with % instead of #
# to test the symbols defined in config.h by configure.

# In the optional second column, there can one or more symbol set names
# listed, which must be in ascending version order reading left to right
# and must appear in this same order in the Versions.def file.  Each listed
# version subsumes all prior versions back to the previous listed version.
#
# An entry with DEFAULT in the first column gives a default second
# column to apply when the matching entry for a particular library has
# no second column.  The defaults must precede the entries they apply
# to.

# Library=version		Earliest symbol set (optional)

# We use the ELF ABI standard name for the default.
ld=ld.so.1

# The -ldl interface (see <dlfcn.h>) is the same on all platforms.

# So far the -lutil interface is the same on all platforms, except for the
# `struct utmp' format, which depends on libc.

# Version number 2 is used on other systems for the BIND 4.9.5 resolver
# interface.

# Interface revision of nss_* modules.  This must match NSS_SHLIB_REVISION
