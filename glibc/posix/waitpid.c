/* Wait for a child matching PID to die.
   If PID is greater than 0, match any process whose process ID is PID.
   If PID is (pid_t) -1, match any process.
   If PID is (pid_t) 0, match any process with the
   same process group as the current process.
   If PID is less than -1, match any process whose
   process group is the absolute value of PID.

   is not already dead, return (pid_t) 0.  If successful,
   return PID and store the dead child's status in STAT_LOC.
