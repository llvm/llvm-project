/* Map addresses starting near ADDR and extending for LEN bytes.  From
   OFFSET into the file FD describes according to PROT and FLAGS.  If ADDR
   is nonzero, it is the desired mapping address.  If the MAP_FIXED bit is
   set in FLAGS, the mapping will be at ADDR exactly (which must be
   page-aligned); otherwise the system chooses a convenient nearby address.
   The return value is the actual mapping address chosen or MAP_FAILED
   for errors (in which case `errno' is set).  A successful `mmap' call
   deallocates any previous mapping for the affected region.  */
