/*
  This is a version (aka ptmalloc2) of malloc/free/realloc written by
  Doug Lea and adapted to multiple threads/arenas by Wolfram Gloger.

  There have been substantial changes made after the integration into
  glibc in all parts of the code.  Do not look for much commonality
  with the ptmalloc2 version.

* Version ptmalloc2-20011215
  based on:
  VERSION 2.7.0 Sun Mar 11 14:14:06 2001  Doug Lea  (dl at gee)

* Quickstart

  In order to compile this implementation, a Makefile is provided with
  the ptmalloc2 distribution, which has pre-defined targets for some
  popular systems (e.g. "make posix" for Posix threads).  All that is
  typically required with regard to compiler flags is the selection of
  the thread package via defining one out of USE_PTHREADS, USE_THR or
  USE_SPROC.  Check the thread-m.h file for what effects this has.
  Many/most systems will additionally require USE_TSD_DATA_HACK to be
  defined, so this is the default for "make posix".

* Why use this malloc?

  This is not the fastest, most space-conserving, most portable, or
  most tunable malloc ever written. However it is among the fastest
  while also being among the most space-conserving, portable and tunable.
  Consistent balance across these factors results in a good general-purpose
  allocator for malloc-intensive programs.

  The main properties of the algorithms are:
  * For large (>= 512 bytes) requests, it is a pure best-fit allocator,
    with ties normally decided via FIFO (i.e. least recently used).
  * For small (<= 64 bytes by default) requests, it is a caching
    allocator, that maintains pools of quickly recycled chunks.
  * In between, and for combinations of large and small requests, it does
    the best it can trying to meet both goals at once.
  * For very large requests (>= 128KB by default), it relies on system
    memory mapping facilities, if supported.

  For a longer but slightly out of date high-level description, see
     http://gee.cs.oswego.edu/dl/html/malloc.html

  You may already by default be using a C library containing a malloc
  that is  based on some version of this malloc (for example in
  linux). You might still want to use the one in this file in order to
  customize settings or to avoid overheads associated with library
  versions.

* Contents, described in more detail in "description of public routines" below.

  Standard (ANSI/SVID/...)  functions:
    malloc(size_t n);
    calloc(size_t n_elements, size_t element_size);
    free(void* p);
    realloc(void* p, size_t n);
    memalign(size_t alignment, size_t n);
    valloc(size_t n);
    mallinfo()
    mallopt(int parameter_number, int parameter_value)

  Additional functions:
    independent_calloc(size_t n_elements, size_t size, void* chunks[]);
    independent_comalloc(size_t n_elements, size_t sizes[], void* chunks[]);
    pvalloc(size_t n);
    malloc_trim(size_t pad);
    malloc_usable_size(void* p);
    malloc_stats();

* Vital statistics:

  Supported pointer representation:       4 or 8 bytes
  Supported size_t  representation:       4 or 8 bytes
       Note that size_t is allowed to be 4 bytes even if pointers are 8.
       You can adjust this by defining INTERNAL_SIZE_T

  Alignment:                              2 * sizeof(size_t) (default)
       (i.e., 8 byte alignment with 4byte size_t). This suffices for
       nearly all current machines and C compilers. However, you can
       define MALLOC_ALIGNMENT to be wider than this if necessary.

  Minimum overhead per allocated chunk:   4 or 8 bytes
       Each malloced chunk has a hidden word of overhead holding size
       and status information.

  Minimum allocated size: 4-byte ptrs:  16 bytes    (including 4 overhead)
			  8-byte ptrs:  24/32 bytes (including, 4/8 overhead)

       When a chunk is freed, 12 (for 4byte ptrs) or 20 (for 8 byte
       ptrs but 4 byte size) or 24 (for 8/8) additional bytes are
       needed; 4 (8) for a trailing size field and 8 (16) bytes for
       free list pointers. Thus, the minimum allocatable size is
       16/24/32 bytes.

       Even a request for zero bytes (i.e., malloc(0)) returns a
       pointer to something of the minimum allocatable size.

       The maximum overhead wastage (i.e., number of extra bytes
       allocated than were requested in malloc) is less than or equal
       to the minimum size, except for requests >= mmap_threshold that
       are serviced via mmap(), where the worst case wastage is 2 *
       sizeof(size_t) bytes plus the remainder from a system page (the
       minimal mmap unit); typically 4096 or 8192 bytes.

  Maximum allocated size:  4-byte size_t: 2^32 minus about two pages
			   8-byte size_t: 2^64 minus about two pages

       It is assumed that (possibly signed) size_t values suffice to
       represent chunk sizes. `Possibly signed' is due to the fact
       that `size_t' may be defined on a system as either a signed or
       an unsigned type. The ISO C standard says that it must be
       unsigned, but a few systems are known not to adhere to this.
       Additionally, even when size_t is unsigned, sbrk (which is by
       default used to obtain memory from system) accepts signed
       arguments, and may not be able to handle size_t-wide arguments
       with negative sign bit.  Generally, values that would
       appear as negative after accounting for overhead and alignment
       are supported only via mmap(), which does not have this
       limitation.

       Requests for sizes outside the allowed range will perform an optional
       failure action and then return null. (Requests may also
       also fail because a system is out of memory.)

  Thread-safety: thread-safe

  Compliance: I believe it is compliant with the 1997 Single Unix Specification
       Also SVID/XPG, ANSI C, and probably others as well.

* Synopsis of compile-time options:

    People have reported using previous versions of this malloc on all
    versions of Unix, sometimes by tweaking some of the defines
    below. It has been tested most extensively on Solaris and Linux.
    People also report using it in stand-alone embedded systems.

    The implementation is in straight, hand-tuned ANSI C.  It is not
    at all modular. (Sorry!)  It uses a lot of macros.  To be at all
    usable, this code should be compiled using an optimizing compiler
    (for example gcc -O3) that can simplify expressions and control
    paths. (FAQ: some macros import variables as arguments rather than
    declare locals because people reported that some debuggers
    otherwise get confused.)

    OPTION                     DEFAULT VALUE

    Compilation Environment options:

    HAVE_MREMAP                0

    Changing default word sizes:

    INTERNAL_SIZE_T            size_t

    Configuration and functionality options:

    REALLOC_ZERO_BYTES_FREES   1
    TRIM_FASTBINS              0

    Options for customizing MORECORE:

    MORECORE                   sbrk
    MORECORE_FAILURE           -1
    MORECORE_CONTIGUOUS        1
    MORECORE_CANNOT_TRIM       NOT defined
    MORECORE_CLEARS            1
    MMAP_AS_MORECORE_SIZE      (1024 * 1024)

    Tuning options that are also dynamically changeable via mallopt:

    DEFAULT_MXFAST             64 (for 32bit), 128 (for 64bit)
    DEFAULT_TRIM_THRESHOLD     128 * 1024

    DEFAULT_MMAP_THRESHOLD     128 * 1024

    There are several other #defined constants and macros that you
    probably don't want to touch unless you are extending or adapting malloc.  */

  Debugging:

  Because freed chunks may be overwritten with bookkeeping fields, this
  malloc will often die when freed memory is overwritten by user
  programs.  This can be very effective (albeit in an annoying way)
  in helping track down dangling pointers.

  If you compile with -DMALLOC_DEBUG, a number of assertion checks are
  enabled that will catch more memory errors. You probably won't be
  able to make much sense of the actual assertion errors, but they
  should help you locate incorrectly overwritten memory.  The checking
  is fairly extensive, and will slow down execution
  noticeably. Calling malloc_stats or mallinfo with MALLOC_DEBUG set
  will attempt to check every non-mmapped allocated and free chunk in
  the course of computing the summmaries. (By nature, mmapped regions
  cannot be checked very much automatically.)

  Setting MALLOC_DEBUG may also be helpful if you are trying to modify
  this code. The assertions in the check routines spell out in more
  detail the assumptions and invariants underlying the algorithms.

  Setting MALLOC_DEBUG does NOT provide an automated mechanism for
  checking that all accesses to malloced memory stay within their
  bounds. However, there are several add-ons and adaptations of this
  or other mallocs available that do this.

/* Memory tagging.  */

/* Some systems support the concept of tagging (sometimes known as
   coloring) memory locations on a fine grained basis.  Each memory
   location is given a color (normally allocated randomly) and
   pointers are also colored.  When the pointer is dereferenced, the
   pointer's color is checked against the memory's color and if they
   differ the access is faulted (sometimes lazily).

   We use this in glibc by maintaining a single color for the malloc
   data structures that are interleaved with the user data and then
   assigning separate colors for each block allocation handed out.  In
   this way simple buffer overruns will be rapidly detected.  When
   memory is freed, the memory is recolored back to the glibc default
   so that simple use-after-free errors can also be detected.

   If memory is reallocated the buffer is recolored even if the
   address remains the same.  This has a performance impact, but
   guarantees that the old pointer cannot mistakenly be reused (code
   that compares old against new will see a mismatch and will then
   need to behave as though realloc moved the data to a new location).

   Internal API for memory tagging support.

   The aim is to keep the code for memory tagging support as close to
   the normal APIs in glibc as possible, so that if tagging is not
   enabled in the library, or is disabled at runtime then standard
   operations can continue to be used.  Support macros are used to do
   this:

   void *tag_new_zero_region (void *ptr, size_t size)

   Allocates a new tag, colors the memory with that tag, zeros the
   memory and returns a pointer that is correctly colored for that
   location.  The non-tagging version will simply call memset with 0.

   void *tag_region (void *ptr, size_t size)

   Color the region of memory pointed to by PTR and size SIZE with
   the color of PTR.  Returns the original pointer.

   void *tag_new_usable (void *ptr)

   Allocate a new random color and use it to color the user region of
   a chunk; this may include data from the subsequent chunk's header
   if tagging is sufficiently fine grained.  Returns PTR suitably
   recolored for accessing the memory there.

   void *tag_at (void *ptr)

   Read the current color of the memory at the address pointed to by
   PTR (ignoring it's current color) and return PTR recolored to that
   color.  PTR must be valid address in all other respects.  When
   tagging is not enabled, it simply returns the original pointer.

  M_MXFAST is the maximum request size used for "fastbins", special bins
  that hold returned chunks without consolidating their spaces. This
  enables future requests for chunks of the same size to be handled
  very quickly, but can increase fragmentation, and thus increase the
  overall memory footprint of a program.

  This malloc manages fastbins very conservatively yet still
  efficiently, so fragmentation is rarely a problem for values less
  than or equal to the default.  The maximum supported value of MXFAST
  is 80. You wouldn't want it any higher than this anyway.  Fastbins
  are designed especially for use with many small structs, objects or
  strings -- the default handles structs/objects/arrays with sizes up
  to 8 4byte fields, or small strings representing words, tokens,
  etc. Using fastbins for larger objects normally worsens
  fragmentation without improving speed.

  M_MXFAST is set in REQUEST size units. It is internally used in
  chunksize units, which adds padding and alignment.  You can reduce
  M_MXFAST to 0 to disable all use of fastbins.  This causes the malloc
  algorithm to be a closer approximation of fifo-best-fit in all cases,
  not just for larger requests, but will generally cause it to be

/*
  M_TRIM_THRESHOLD is the maximum amount of unused top-most memory
  to keep before releasing via malloc_trim in free().

  Automatic trimming is mainly useful in long-lived programs.
  Because trimming via sbrk can be slow on some systems, and can
  sometimes be wasteful (in cases where programs immediately
  afterward allocate more large chunks) the value should be high
  enough so that your overall system performance would improve by
  releasing this much memory.

  The trim threshold and the mmap control parameters (see below)
  can be traded off with one another. Trimming and mmapping are
  two different ways of releasing unused memory back to the
  system. Between these two, it is often possible to keep
  system-level demands of a long-lived program down to a bare
  minimum. For example, in one test suite of sessions measuring
  the XF86 X server on Linux, using a trim threshold of 128K and a
  mmap threshold of 192K led to near-minimal long term resource
  consumption.

  If you are using this malloc in a long-lived program, it should
  pay to experiment with these values.  As a rough guide, you
  might set to a value close to the average size of a process
  (program) running on your system.  Releasing this much memory
  would allow such a process to run in memory.  Generally, it's
  worth it to tune for trimming rather tham memory mapping when a
  program undergoes phases where several large chunks are
  allocated and released in ways that can reuse each other's
  storage, perhaps mixed with phases where there are no such
  chunks at all.  And in well-behaved long-lived programs,
  controlling release of large blocks via trimming versus mapping
  is usually faster.

  However, in most programs, these parameters serve mainly as
  protection against the system-level effects of carrying around
  massive amounts of unneeded memory. Since frequent calls to
  sbrk, mmap, and munmap otherwise degrade performance, the default
  parameters are set to relatively high values that serve only as
  safeguards.

  The trim value It must be greater than page size to have any useful
  effect.  To disable trimming completely, you can set to
  (unsigned long)(-1)

  Trim settings interact with fastbin (MXFAST) settings: Unless
  TRIM_FASTBINS is defined, automatic trimming never takes place upon
  freeing a chunk with size less than or equal to MXFAST. Trimming is
  instead delayed until subsequent freeing of larger chunks. However,
  you can still force an attempted trim by calling malloc_trim.

  Also, trimming is not generally possible in cases where
  the main arena is obtained via mmap.

  Note that the trick some people use of mallocing a huge space and
  then freeing it at program startup, in an attempt to reserve system
  memory, doesn't have the intended effect under automatic trimming,
  since that memory will immediately be returned to the system.

  M_TOP_PAD is the amount of extra `padding' space to allocate or

  * When sbrk is called to extend the top of the arena to satisfy

  request.

  * When malloc_trim is called automatically from free(),
  it is used as the `pad' argument.

  In both cases, the actual amount of padding is rounded
  so that the end of the arena is always a system page boundary.

  The main reason for using padding is to avoid calling sbrk so
  often. Having even a small pad greatly reduces the likelihood
  that nearly every malloc request during program start-up (or
  after trimming) will invoke sbrk, which needlessly wastes
  time.

  Automatic rounding-up to page-size units is normally sufficient
  to avoid measurable overhead, so the default is 0.  However, in
  systems where sbrk is relatively slow, it can pay to increase

  M_MMAP_THRESHOLD is the request size threshold for using mmap()
  to service a request. Requests of at least this size that cannot
  be allocated using already-existing space will be serviced via mmap.
  (If enough normal freed space already exists it is used instead.)

  Using mmap segregates relatively large chunks of memory so that
  they can be individually obtained and released from the host
  system. A request serviced through mmap is never reused by any
  other request (at least not directly; the system may just so
  happen to remap successive requests to the same locations).

  Segregating space in this way has the benefits that:

   1. Mmapped space can ALWAYS be individually released back
      to the system, which helps keep the system level memory
      demands of a long-lived program low.
   2. Mapped memory can never become `locked' between
      other chunks, as can happen with normally allocated chunks, which
      means that even trimming via malloc_trim would not release them.
   3. On some systems with "holes" in address spaces, mmap can obtain
      memory that sbrk cannot.

  However, it has the disadvantages that:

   1. The space cannot be reclaimed, consolidated, and then
      used to service later requests, as happens with normal chunks.
   2. It can lead to more wastage because of mmap page alignment
      requirements
   3. It causes malloc performance to be more dependent on host
      system memory management support routines which may vary in
      implementation quality and may impose arbitrary
      limitations. Generally, servicing a request via normal
      malloc steps is faster than going through a system's mmap.

  The advantages of mmap nearly always outweigh disadvantages for
  "large" chunks, but the value of "large" varies across systems.  The
  default is an empirically derived value that works well in most
  systems.


  Update in 2006:
  The above was written in 2001. Since then the world has changed a lot.
  Memory got bigger. Applications got bigger. The virtual address space
  layout in 32 bit linux changed.

  In the new situation, brk() and mmap space is shared and there are no
  artificial limits on brk size imposed by the kernel. What is more,
  applications have started using transient allocations larger than the
  128Kb as was imagined in 2001.

  The price for mmap is also high now; each time glibc mmaps from the
  kernel, the kernel is forced to zero out the memory it gives to the
  application. Zeroing memory is expensive and eats a lot of cache and
  memory bandwidth. This has nothing to do with the efficiency of the
  virtual memory system, by doing mmap the kernel just has no choice but
  to zero.

  In 2001, the kernel had a maximum size for brk() which was about 800
  megabytes on 32 bit x86, at that point brk() would hit the first
  mmaped shared libaries and couldn't expand anymore. With current 2.6
  kernels, the VA space layout is different and brk() and mmap
  both can span the entire heap at will.

  Rather than using a static threshold for the brk/mmap tradeoff,
  we are now using a simple dynamic one. The goal is still to avoid
  fragmentation. The old goals we kept are
  1) try to get the long lived large allocations to use mmap()
  2) really large allocations should always use mmap()
  and we're adding now:
  3) transient allocations should use brk() to avoid forcing the kernel
     having to zero memory over and over again

  The implementation works with a sliding threshold, which is by default
  limited to go between 128Kb and 32Mb (64Mb for 64 bitmachines) and starts
  out at 128Kb as per the 2001 default.

  This allows us to satisfy requirement 1) under the assumption that long
  lived allocations are made early in the process' lifespan, before it has
  started doing dynamic allocations of the same size (which will
  increase the threshold).

  The upperbound on the threshold satisfies requirement 2)

  The threshold goes up in value when the application frees memory that was
  allocated with the mmap allocator. The idea is that once the application
  starts freeing memory of a certain size, it's highly probable that this is
  a size the application uses for transient allocations. This estimator
  is there to satisfy the new third requirement.

   malloc_chunk details:

    (The following includes lightly edited explanations by Colin Plumb.)

    Chunks of memory are maintained using a `boundary tag' method as
    described in e.g., Knuth or Standish.  (See the paper by Paul
    Wilson ftp://ftp.cs.utexas.edu/pub/garbage/allocsrv.ps for a
    survey of such techniques.)  Sizes of free chunks are stored both
    in the front of each chunk and at the end.  This makes
    consolidating fragmented chunks into bigger chunks very fast.  The
    size fields also hold bits representing whether chunks are free or
    in use.

    An allocated chunk looks like this:


    chunk-> +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
	    |             Size of previous chunk, if unallocated (P clear)  |
	    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
	    |             Size of chunk, in bytes                     |A|M|P|
      mem-> +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
	    |             User data starts here...                          .
	    .                                                               .
	    .             (malloc_usable_size() bytes)                      .
	    .                                                               |
nextchunk-> +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
	    |             (size of chunk, but used for application data)    |
	    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
	    |             Size of next chunk, in bytes                |A|0|1|
	    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

    Where "chunk" is the front of the chunk for the purpose of most of
    the malloc code, but "mem" is the pointer that is returned to the
    user.  "Nextchunk" is the beginning of the next contiguous chunk.

    Chunks always begin on even word boundaries, so the mem portion
    (which is returned to the user) is also on an even word boundary, and
    thus at least double-word aligned.

    Free chunks are stored in circular doubly-linked lists, and look like this:

    chunk-> +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
	    |             Size of previous chunk, if unallocated (P clear)  |
	    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
    `head:' |             Size of chunk, in bytes                     |A|0|P|
      mem-> +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
	    |             Forward pointer to next chunk in list             |
	    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
	    |             Back pointer to previous chunk in list            |
	    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
	    |             Unused space (may be 0 bytes long)                .
	    .                                                               .
	    .                                                               |
nextchunk-> +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
    `foot:' |             Size of chunk, in bytes                           |
	    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
	    |             Size of next chunk, in bytes                |A|0|0|
	    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

    The P (PREV_INUSE) bit, stored in the unused low-order bit of the
    chunk size (which is always a multiple of two words), is an in-use
    bit for the *previous* chunk.  If that bit is *clear*, then the
    word before the current chunk size contains the previous chunk
    size, and can be used to find the front of the previous chunk.
    The very first chunk allocated always has this bit set,
    preventing access to non-existent (or non-owned) memory. If
    prev_inuse is set for any given chunk, then you CANNOT determine
    the size of the previous chunk, and might even get a memory
    addressing fault when trying to do so.

    The A (NON_MAIN_ARENA) bit is cleared for chunks on the initial,
    main arena, described by the main_arena variable.  When additional
    threads are spawned, each thread receives its own arena (up to a
    configurable limit, after which arenas are reused for multiple
    threads), and the chunks in these arenas have the A bit set.  To
    find the arena for a chunk on such a non-main arena, heap_for_ptr
    performs a bit mask operation and indirection through the ar_ptr
    member of the per-heap header heap_info (see arena.c).

    Note that the `foot' of the current chunk is actually represented
    as the prev_size of the NEXT chunk. This makes it easier to
    deal with alignments etc but can be very confusing when trying
    to extend or adapt this code.

    The three exceptions to all this are:

     1. The special chunk `top' doesn't bother using the
	trailing size field since there is no next contiguous chunk
	that would have to index off it. After initialization, `top'
	is forced to always exist.  If it would become less than
	MINSIZE bytes long, it is replenished.

     2. Chunks allocated via mmap, which have the second-lowest-order
	bit M (IS_MMAPPED) set in their size fields.  Because they are
	allocated one-by-one, each must contain its own trailing size
	field.  If the M bit is set, the other bits are ignored
	(because mmapped chunks are neither in an arena, nor adjacent
	to a freed chunk).  The M bit is also used for chunks which
	originally came from a dumped heap via malloc_set_state in
	hooks.c.

     3. Chunks in fastbins are treated as allocated chunks from the
	point of view of the chunk allocator.  They are consolidated
	with their neighbors only in bulk, in malloc_consolidate.

/*
  ---------- Size and alignment checks and conversions ----------
*/

/* Conversion from malloc headers to user pointers, and back.  When
   using memory tagging the user data and the malloc data structure
   headers have distinct tags.  Converting fully from one to the other
   involves extracting the tag at the other address and creating a
   suitable pointer using it.  That can be quite expensive.  There are
   cases when the pointers are not dereferenced (for example only used
   for alignment check) so the tags are not relevant, and there are
   cases when user data is not tagged distinctly from malloc headers
   (user data is untagged because tagging is done late in malloc and
   early in free).  User memory tagging across internal interfaces:

      sysmalloc: Returns untagged memory.
      _int_malloc: Returns untagged memory.

/*
   Bins

    An array of bin headers for free chunks. Each bin is doubly
    linked.  The bins are approximately proportionally (log) spaced.
    There are a lot of these bins (128). This may look excessive, but
    works very well in practice.  Most bins hold sizes that are
    unusual as malloc request sizes, but are more usual for fragments
    and consolidated sets of chunks, which is what these bins hold, so
    they can be found quickly.  All procedures maintain the invariant
    that no consolidated chunk physically borders another one, so each
    chunk in a list is known to be preceeded and followed by either
    inuse chunks or the ends of memory.

    Chunks in bins are kept in size order, with ties going to the
    approximately least recently used chunk. Ordering isn't needed
    for the small bins, which all contain the same-sized chunks, but
    facilitates best-fit allocation for larger chunks. These lists
    are just sequential. Keeping them in order almost never requires
    enough traversal to warrant using fancier ordered data
    structures.

    Chunks of the same size are linked with the most
    recently freed at the front, and allocations are taken from the
    back.  This results in LRU (FIFO) allocation order, which tends
    to give each chunk an equal opportunity to be consolidated with
    adjacent freed chunks, resulting in larger free chunks and less
    fragmentation.

    To simplify use in double-linked lists, each bin header acts
    as a malloc_chunk. This avoids special-casing for headers.
    But to conserve space and improve locality, we allocate
    only the fd/bk pointers of bins, and then use repositioning tricks
    to treat these as the fields of a malloc_chunk*.

   Indexing

    Bins for sizes < 512 bytes contain chunks of all the same size, spaced
    8 bytes apart. Larger bins are approximately logarithmically spaced:

    64 bins of size       8
    32 bins of size      64
    16 bins of size     512
     8 bins of size    4096

     2 bins of size  262144
     1 bin  of size what's left

    There is actually a little bit of slop in the numbers in bin_index
    for the sake of speed. This makes no difference elsewhere.

    The bins top out around 1MB because we expect to service large
    requests via mmap.

    a valid chunk size the small bins are bumped up one.

/*
   -------------------- Alternative MORECORE functions --------------------
 */


/*
   General Requirements for MORECORE.

   The MORECORE function must have the following properties:

   If MORECORE_CONTIGUOUS is false:

 * MORECORE must allocate in multiples of pagesize. It will
      only be called with arguments that are multiples of pagesize.

 * MORECORE(0) must return an address that is at least
      MALLOC_ALIGNMENT aligned. (Page-aligning always suffices.)

   else (i.e. If MORECORE_CONTIGUOUS is true):

 * Consecutive calls to MORECORE with positive arguments
      return increasing addresses, indicating that space has been
      contiguously extended.

 * MORECORE need not allocate in multiples of pagesize.
      Calls to MORECORE need not have args of multiples of pagesize.

 * MORECORE need not page-align.

   In either case:

 * MORECORE may allocate more memory than requested. (Or even less,
      but this will generally result in a malloc failure.)

 * MORECORE must not allocate memory when given argument zero, but
      instead return one past the end address of memory from previous
      nonzero call. This malloc does NOT call MORECORE(0)
      until at least one call with positive arguments is made, so
      the initial value returned is not important.

 * Even though consecutive calls to MORECORE need not return contiguous
      addresses, it must be OK for malloc'ed chunks to span multiple
      regions in those cases where they do happen to be contiguous.

 * MORECORE need not handle negative arguments -- it may instead
      just return MORECORE_FAILURE when given negative arguments.
      Negative arguments are always multiples of pagesize. MORECORE
      must not misinterpret negative args as large positive unsigned
      args. You can suppress all such calls from even occurring by defining
      MORECORE_CANNOT_TRIM,

   There is some variation across systems about the type of the
   argument to sbrk/MORECORE. If size_t is unsigned, then it cannot
   actually be size_t, because sbrk supports negative args, so it is
   normally the signed type of the same width as size_t (sometimes
   declared as "intptr_t", and sometimes "ptrdiff_t").  It doesn't much
   matter though. Internally, we use "long" as arguments, which should
   work across all reasonable possibilities.

   Additionally, if MORECORE ever returns failure for a positive
   request, then mmap is used as a noncontiguous system allocator. This
   is a useful backup strategy for systems with holes in address spaces
   -- in this case sbrk cannot contiguously expand the heap, but mmap
   may be able to map noncontiguous space.

   If you'd like mmap to ALWAYS be used, you can define MORECORE to be
   a function that always returns MORECORE_FAILURE.

   If you are using this malloc with something other than sbrk (or its
   emulation) to supply memory regions, you probably want to set
   MORECORE_CONTIGUOUS as false.  As an example, here is a custom
   allocator kindly contributed for pre-OSX macOS.  It uses virtually
   but not necessarily physically contiguous non-paged memory (locked
   in, present and won't get swapped out).  You can use it by
   uncommenting this section, adding some #includes, and setting up the
   appropriate defines above:

 *#define MORECORE osMoreCore
 *#define MORECORE_CONTIGUOUS 0

   There is also a shutdown routine that should somehow be called for
   cleanup upon program exit.

 *#define MAX_POOL_ENTRIES 100
 *#define MINIMUM_MORECORE_SIZE  (64 * 1024)
   static int next_os_pool;
   void *our_os_pools[MAX_POOL_ENTRIES];

   void *osMoreCore(int size)
   {
    void *ptr = 0;
    static void *sbrk_top = 0;

    if (size > 0)
    {
      if (size < MINIMUM_MORECORE_SIZE)
         size = MINIMUM_MORECORE_SIZE;
      if (CurrentExecutionLevel() == kTaskLevel)
         ptr = PoolAllocateResident(size + RM_PAGE_SIZE, 0);
      if (ptr == 0)
      {
        return (void *) MORECORE_FAILURE;
      }
      // save ptrs so they can be freed during cleanup
      our_os_pools[next_os_pool] = ptr;
      next_os_pool++;
      ptr = (void *) ((((unsigned long) ptr) + RM_PAGE_MASK) & ~RM_PAGE_MASK);
      sbrk_top = (char *) ptr + size;
      return ptr;
    }
    else if (size < 0)
    {
      // we don't currently support shrink behavior
      return (void *) MORECORE_FAILURE;
    }
    else
    {
      return sbrk_top;
    }
   }

   // cleanup any allocated memory pools
   // called as last thing before shutting down driver

   void osCleanupMem(void)
   {
    void **ptr;

    for (ptr = our_os_pools; ptr < &our_os_pools[MAX_POOL_ENTRIES]; ptr++)
      if (*ptr)
      {
         PoolDeallocate(*ptr);
 * ptr = 0;
      }
   }
