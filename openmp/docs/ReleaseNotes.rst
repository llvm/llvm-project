Introduction
============

This document contains the release notes for the OpenMP runtime, release 16.0.0.
Here we describe the status of OpenMP, including major improvements
from the previous release. All OpenMP releases may be downloaded
from the `LLVM releases web site <https://llvm.org/releases/>`_.

Non-comprehensive list of changes in this release
=================================================

* OpenMP target offloading will no longer support on 32-bit Linux systems.
  ``libomptarget`` and plugins will not be built on 32-bit systems.

* Support for building the OpenMP runtime for Windows on AArch64 and ARM
  with MinGW based toolchains.

* Made the OpenMP runtime tests run successfully on Windows.

* Improved performance and internalization when compiling in LTO mode using
  ``-foffload-lto``.

* Created the ``nvptx-arch`` and ``amdgpu-arch`` tools to query the user's
  installed GPUs.

* Removed ``CLANG_OPENMP_NVPTX_DEFAULT_ARCH`` in favor of using the new
  ``nvptx-arch`` tool.

* Added support for ``--offload-arch=native`` which queries the user's locally
  available GPU architectures. Now ``-fopenmp --offload-arch=native`` is
  sufficient to target all of the user's GPUs.

* Added ``-fopenmp-target-jit`` to enable JIT support. Only basic JIT feature is
  supported in this release. A couple of JIT related environment variables were
  added, which can be found on `LLVM/OpenMP runtimes page <https://openmp.llvm.org/design/Runtimes.html#libomptarget-jit-opt-level>`.

* OpenMP now supports ``-Xarch_host`` to control sending compiler arguments only
  to the host compilation.

* Improved ``clang-format`` when used on OpenMP offloading applications.

* ``f16`` suffix is supported when compiling OpenMP programs if the target
  supports it.

* Python 3 is required to run OpenMP LIT tests now.

* Fixed a number of bugs and regressions.

* Improved host thread utilization on target nowait regions. Target tasks are
  now continuously re-enqueued by the OpenMP runtime until their device-side
  operations are completed, unblocking the host thread to execute other tasks.

* Target tasks re-enqueue can be controlled on a per-thread basis based on
  exponential backoff counting. ``OMPTARGET_QUERY_COUNT_THRESHOLD`` defines how
  many target tasks must be re-enqueued before the thread starts blocking on the
  device operations (defaults to 10). ``OMPTARGET_QUERY_COUNT_MAX`` defines the
  maximum value for the per-thread re-enqueue counter (defaults to 5).
  ``OMPTARGET_QUERY_COUNT_BACKOFF_FACTOR`` defines the decrement factor applied
  to the counter when a target task is completed (defaults to 0.5).
