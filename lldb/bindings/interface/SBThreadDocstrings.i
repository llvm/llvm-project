"Represents a thread of execution. :py:class:`SBProcess` contains SBThread(s).

SBThreads can be referred to by their ID, which maps to the system specific thread
identifier, or by IndexID.  The ID may or may not be unique depending on whether the
system reuses its thread identifiers.  The IndexID is a monotonically increasing identifier
that will always uniquely reference a particular thread, and when that thread goes
away it will not be reused.

SBThread supports frame iteration. For example (from test/python_api/
lldbutil/iter/TestLLDBIterator.py), ::

        from lldbutil import print_stacktrace
        stopped_due_to_breakpoint = False
        for thread in process:
            if self.TraceOn():
                print_stacktrace(thread)
            ID = thread.GetThreadID()
            if thread.GetStopReason() == lldb.eStopReasonBreakpoint:
                stopped_due_to_breakpoint = True
            for frame in thread:
                self.assertTrue(frame.GetThread().GetThreadID() == ID)
                if self.TraceOn():
                    print frame

    LLDB currently supports process centric debugging which means when any
    thread in a process stops, all other threads are stopped. The Suspend()
    call here tells our process to suspend a thread and not let it run when
    the other threads in a process are allowed to run. So when
    SBProcess::Continue() is called, any threads that aren't suspended will
    be allowed to run. If any of the SBThread functions for stepping are
    called (StepOver, StepInto, StepOut, StepInstruction, RunToAddres), the
    thread will now be allowed to run and these functions will simply return.

    Eventually we plan to add support for thread centric debugging where
    each thread is controlled individually and each thread would broadcast
    its state, but we haven't implemented this yet.

    Likewise the SBThread::Resume() call will again allow the thread to run
    when the process is continued.
