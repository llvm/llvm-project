class ResultsFormatter(object):
    """Provides interface to formatting test results out to a file-like object.

    This class allows the LLDB test framework's raw test-related
    events to be processed and formatted in any manner desired.
    Test events are represented by python dictionaries, formatted
    as in the EventBuilder class above.

    ResultFormatter instances are given a file-like object in which
    to write their results.

    ResultFormatter lifetime looks like the following:

    # The result formatter is created.

    # Single call to session start, before parsing any events.
    formatter.begin_session()

    # Zero or more calls specified for events recorded during the test session.
    # The parallel test runner manages getting results from all the inferior
    # dotest processes, so from a new format perspective, don't worry about
    # that.  The formatter will be presented with a single stream of events
    # sandwiched between a single begin_session()/end_session() pair in the
    # parallel test runner process/thread.
    for event in zero_or_more_test_events():
        formatter.handle_event(event)

    # Single call to terminate/wrap-up. For formatters that need all the
    # data before they can print a correct result (e.g. xUnit/JUnit),
    # this is where the final report can be generated.
    formatter.handle_event({"event":"terminate",...})

    It is not the formatter's responsibility to close the file_like_object.
    (i.e. do not close it).

    The lldb test framework passes these test events in real time, so they
    arrive as they come in.

    Note more events may be added in the future to support richer test
    reporting functionality. One example: creating a true flaky test
    result category so that unexpected successes really mean the test
    is marked incorrectly (either should be marked flaky, or is indeed
    passing consistently now and should have the xfail marker
    removed). In this case, a flaky_success and flaky_fail event
    likely will be added to capture these and support reporting things
    like percentages of flaky test passing so we can see if we're
    making some things worse/better with regards to failure rates.

    Another example: announcing all the test methods that are planned
    to be run, so we can better support redo operations of various kinds
    (redo all non-run tests, redo non-run tests except the one that
    was running [perhaps crashed], etc.)

    Implementers are expected to override all the public methods
    provided in this class. See each method's docstring to see
    expectations about when the call should be chained.
