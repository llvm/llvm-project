# FIXME: The expression evaluator tries to attach
# the static member's VarDecl to the NoCtor RecordDecl
# before passing the AST to clang; this requires the
# RecordDecl to be a full definition. But the debug-info
# only contains forward declaration for NoCtor. So
# LLDB fails to evaluate the expression.
