# This test verifies that LLDB can read DWARF file that contains DW_FORM values
# encoded with the DW_FORM_GNU_ref_alt and DW_FORM_GNU_strp_alt. If any file was
# loaded into LLDB prior to adding support LLDB wouldn't be able to parse any
# of the DWARF as it wouldn't know how to parse these entries and since DWARF is
# a stream, nothing after that could be parsed.

# RUN: yaml2obj %S/Inputs/gnu-ref-strp-alt.yaml > %t
# RUN: %lldb %t -b -o 'b bar' | FileCheck %s

# CHECK:      (lldb) b bar
# CHECK-NOT:  unsupported DW_FORM values:
# CHECK:      Breakpoint 1: address = 0x0000000000001000
