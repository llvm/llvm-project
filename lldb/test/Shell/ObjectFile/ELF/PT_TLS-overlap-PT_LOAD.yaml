# Overlapping PT_LOAD and PT_TLS segments in an object file should be able to
# exist side by side.

# When an ELF file contains both PT_LOAD and PT_TLS segments where the PT_TLS
# segment has the same p_vaddr and p_paddr as a PT_LOAD segment, this
# was causing LLDB, when loading a ELF object file at an address, to overwrite
# the section load address for a PT_LOAD that shares the same p_vaddr value in
# the section load list's addr to section map for this code. This test ensures
# that no PT_TLS segments get loaded and can't interfere with real segments we
# need to resolved as all access to thread specific memory is only done via
# DWARF location expressions. We also don't have any code that loads any thread
# specific segments at a different address for different threads, so there is
# no reason currently to try and load thread specific segments.
