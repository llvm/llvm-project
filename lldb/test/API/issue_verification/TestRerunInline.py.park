"""Tests that the rerun mechanism respects lldbinline-created tests.

The current implementation of this test is expected to fail both on
the initial run and on the rerun, assuming --rerun-all-issues is provided
to the dotest.py run.

This test could be improved by doing something in the test inferior
C++ program that could look for the "should an issue be raised" marker
file, and then really pass on the rerun.
