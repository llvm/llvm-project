        Tests that the "scopes" request causes the currently selected
        thread and frame to be updated. There are no DAP packets that tell
        lldb-dap which thread and frame are selected other than the
        "scopes" request. lldb-dap will now select the thread and frame
        for the latest "scopes" request that it receives.

        The LLDB command interpreter needs to have the right thread and
        frame selected so that commands executed in the debug console act
        on the right scope. This applies both to the expressions that are
        evaluated and the lldb commands that start with the backtick
