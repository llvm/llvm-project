//===----------------------------------------------------------------------===//

Welcome to the repository of extra Clang Tools.  This repository holds tools
that are developed as part of the LLVM compiler infrastructure project and the
Clang frontend.  These tools are kept in a separate "extra" repository to
allow lighter weight checkouts of the core Clang codebase.

All discussion regarding Clang, Clang-based tools, and code in this repository
should be held using the standard Clang forums:
  https://discourse.llvm.org/c/clang
  https://discourse.llvm.org/c/clang/clang-tidy/71
  https://discourse.llvm.org/c/clang/clangd/34

Code review for this tree should take place on Github:
  https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pulls?q=label%3Aclang-tools-extra

If you find a bug in these tools, please file it in the LLVM bug tracker:
  https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues/
