readability-use-span-first-last
===============================

Suggests using ``std::span::first()`` and ``std::span::last()`` member functions 
instead of equivalent ``subspan()``. These dedicated methods were added to C++20 
to provide more expressive alternatives to common subspan operations.

Covered scenarios:

=========================== ==============
Expression                  Replacement
--------------------------- --------------
``s.subspan(0, n)``         ``s.first(n)``
``s.subspan(s.size() - n)`` ``s.last(n)``
=========================== ==============


Non-zero offset with count (like ``subspan(1, n)``) or offset-only calls 
(like ``subspan(n)``) have no clearer equivalent using ``first()`` or 
``last()``, so these cases are not transformed.

This check is only active when C++20 or later is used.
