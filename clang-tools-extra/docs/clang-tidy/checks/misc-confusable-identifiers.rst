misc-confusable-identifiers
===========================

Warn about confusable identifiers, i.e. identifiers that are visually close to
each other, but use different Unicode characters. This detects a potential
attack described in `CVE-2021-42574 <https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-42574>`_.

Example:

.. code-block:: c++

    int fo; // Initial character is U+0066 (LATIN SMALL LETTER F).
    int ùêüo; // Initial character is U+1234 (SUPER COOL AWESOME UPPERCASE NOT LATIN F) not U+0066 (LATIN SMALL LETTER F).
