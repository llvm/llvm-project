hicpp-new-delete-operators
==========================

This check is an alias for :doc:`misc-new-delete-overloads <../misc/new-delete-overloads>`.
Implements `rule 12.3.1 <https://www.perforce.com/resources/qac/high-integrity-cpp-coding-standard/special-member-functions>`_ to ensure
the `new` and `delete` operators have the correct signature.
