portability-avoid-platform-specific-fundamental-types
=====================================================

Finds fundamental types (e.g. ``int``, ``float``) and recommends using typedefs
or fixed-width types to improve portability across different platforms.

This check detects fundamental types (``int``, ``short``, ``long``, ``float``,
``char`` and their ``unsigned`` or ``signed`` variants) and warns against their
use due to non-standard platform-dependent behavior. For example, ``long`` is
64 bits on Linux but 32 bits on Windows. There is no standard rationale or
intent for the sizes of these types.

Instead of fundamental types, use fixed-width types such as ``int32_t`` or
implementation-defined types with standard semantics, e.g. ``int_fast32_t`` for
the fastest integer type greater than or equal to 32 bits.

Examples
--------

.. code-block:: c++

  // Bad: platform-dependent fundamental types
  int global_int = 42;
  short global_short = 10;
  long global_long = 100L;
  unsigned long global_unsigned_long = 100UL;

  void function_with_int_param(int param) {
    // ...
  }

  int function_returning_int() {
    return 42;
  }

  struct MyStruct {
    int member_int;
    long member_long;
  };

.. code-block:: c++

  // Good: use fixed-width types or typedefs
  #include <cstdint>

  int32_t global_int32 = 42;
  int16_t global_int16 = 10;
  int64_t global_int64 = 100L;
  uint64_t global_uint64 = 100UL;

  void function_with_int32_param(int32_t param) {
    // ...
  }

  int32_t function_returning_int32() {
    return 42;
  }

  struct MyStruct {
    int32_t member_int32;
    int64_t member_int64;
  };

The check will also warn about typedef declarations that use fundamental types
as their underlying type:

.. code-block:: c++

  // Bad: typedef using fundamental type
  typedef long long MyLongType;
  using MyIntType = int;

.. code-block:: c++

  // Good: use descriptive names or fixed-width types
  typedef int64_t TimestampType;
  using CounterType = uint32_t;

Rationale
---------

Fundamental types have platform-dependent sizes and behavior:

- ``int`` is typically 32 bits on modern platforms but is only guaranteed to be
  16 bits by the spec
- ``long int`` is 32 bits on Windows but 64 bits on most Unix systems
- ``double`` is typically 64-bit IEEE754, but on some microcontrollers without
  a 64-bit FPU (e.g. certain Arduinos) it can be 32 bits
- ``char`` is signed on ARM and unsigned on x86

For historical reasons, the C++ standard allows the implementation to define
the size and representation of these types. They communicate intent in
non-standard ways and are often needlessly incompatible.

For example, ``int`` was traditionally the word size of a given processor in
16-bit and 32-bit computing and was a reasonable default for performance. This
is no longer true on modern 64-bit computers, but the size of ``int`` remains
fixed at 32 bits for backwards compatibility with code that relied on a 32-bit
implementation of ``int``.

If code is explicitly relying on the size of an ``int`` being 32 bits, it is
better to say so in the typename with ``int32_t``. Otherwise, use an
appropriate implementation-defined type such as ``fast_int32_t`` or
``least_int32_t`` that communicates the appropriate time/space tradeoff.

Likewise, ``float`` and ``double`` should be replaced by ``float32_t`` and
``float64_t`` which are guaranteed to be standard IEEE754 floats for a given
size.

``char`` should be replaced by ``char8_t`` when used in the representation of
Unicode text. When used to represent a byte on a given platform, ``std::byte``
is an appropriate replacement.

Types Not Flagged
-----------------

The following types are intentionally not flagged:

- ``bool`` (boolean type)
- Standard library typedefs like ``size_t``, ``ptrdiff_t``, or ``uint32_t``.
- Already typedef'd types, though the check will flag the typedef itself

``bool`` is excluded because it can only be true or false, and is not
vulnerable to overflow or narrowing issues that occur as a result of using
types of an implementation-defined size.

Options
-------

.. option:: WarnOnInts

   When `true` (default), the check will warn about fundamental integer types
   (``short``, ``int``, ``long``, ``long long`` and their ``signed`` and 
   ``unsigned`` variants).
   When `false`, integer types are not flagged.

   Example with `WarnOnInts` enabled:

   .. code-block:: c++

     // Bad: platform-dependent integer types
     #include <vector>

     int counter = 0;
     long timestamp = 12345L;
     unsigned short port = 8080;

     std::vector<uint32_t> vec;
     // If int is 32 bits and (vec.size > 2^31 - 1), this overflows
     for(int i = 0; i<vec.size();i++) {
       vec[i];
     }

   .. code-block:: c++

     // Good: use fixed-width or descriptive types
     #include <cstdint>
     #include <vector>

     int32_t counter = 0;           // When you need exactly 32 bits
     int64_t timestamp = 12345L;    // When you need exactly 64 bits
     uint16_t port = 8080;          // When you need exactly 16 unsigned bits
     std::vector<uint32_t> vec;
     // A size_t is the maximum size of an object on a given platform
     for(size_t i = 0U; i<vec.size();i++) {
       vec[i];
     }

.. option:: WarnOnFloats

   When `true` (default), the check will warn about floating point types
   (``float`` and ``double``).
   When `false`, floating point types are not flagged.

   Floating point types can have platform-dependent behavior:

   - ``float`` is typically 32-bit IEEE754, but can vary on some platforms
   - ``double`` is typically 64-bit IEEE754, but on some microcontrollers
    without a 64-bit FPU it can be 32 bits

   When this option is enabled, the check will suggest using ``float32_t`` and
   ``float64_t`` instead of ``float`` and ``double`` respectively, when the
   target platform supports standard IEEE754 sizes.

   Example with ``WarnOnFloats`` enabled:

   .. code-block:: c++

     // Bad: platform-dependent floating point types
     float pi = 3.14f;
     double e = 2.71828;

   .. code-block:: c++

     // Good: use fixed-width floating point types
     #include <stdfloat>  // C++23

     float32_t pi = 3.14f;
     float64_t e = 2.71828;

.. option:: WarnOnChars

   When `true` (default), the check will warn about character types (``char``,
   ``signed char``, and ``unsigned char``).
   When `false`, character types are not flagged.

   Character types can have platform-dependent behavior:

   - ``char`` can be either signed or unsigned depending on the platform (signed
     on ARM, unsigned on x86)
   - The signedness of ``char`` affects comparisons and arithmetic operations

   When this option is enabled, the check will suggest using explicit signedness
   or typedefs to make the intent clear and ensure consistent behavior across
   platforms.

   Example with :option:`WarnOnChars` enabled:

   .. code-block:: c++

     // Bad: platform-dependent character types
     char buffer[256];
     signed char byte_value = -1;
     unsigned char raw_byte = 255;

   .. code-block:: c++

     // Good: use explicit types or typedefs
     using byte_t = unsigned char;  // For raw byte data
     using text_char_t = char;      // For text (when signedness doesn't matter)

     text_char_t buffer[256];       // For text storage
     int8_t signed_byte = -1;       // For signed 8-bit values
     uint8_t raw_byte = 255;        // For unsigned 8-bit values
