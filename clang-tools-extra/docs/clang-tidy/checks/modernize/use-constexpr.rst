.. title:: clang-tidy - modernize-use-constexpr

modernize-use-constexpr
=======================

Finds functions and variables that can be declared 'constexpr'.

The check analyses any function and variable according to the rules defined
for the language version that the code is compiled with.
Changing to a newer language standard may therefore offer additional opportunity
to declare a function or variable as ``constexpr``.
Furthermore, this check can be incremental in terms of its diagnostics. For
example, declaring a function ``constepxr`` might create new opportunities of
marking additional variables or function ``constexpr``, which can only be found
in subsequent runs of this check.

For variables, the check will only detect variables that can be declared
``constexpr`` if they are already ``const``.
This is because this check would have to duplicate the expensive analysis of the
:doc:`misc-const-correctness<../misc/const-correctness>` check.
Therefore, it is recommended to have 
:doc:`misc-const-correctness<../misc/const-correctness>` enabled
in the Clang-Tidy config when this check is, so that all opportunities for
``const`` and also ``constexpr`` are explored.

Options
-------

.. option:: ConservativeLiteralType

  With this option enabled, only literal types that can be constructed at
  compile-time are considered to supoprt ``constexpr``.

  .. code-block:: c++

    struct NonLiteral{
      NonLiteral();
      ~NonLiteral();
      int &ref;
    };

  This type is a literal type, but can not be constructed at compile-time.
  With `ConservativeLiteralType` equal to `true`, variables or funtions
  with this type are not diagnosed to add ``constexpr``. Default is
  `true`.

.. option:: AddConstexprToMethodOfClassWithoutConstexprConstructor

  While a function of a class or struct could be declared ``constexpr``, when
  the class itself can never be constructed at compile-time, then adding
  ``constexpr`` to a member function is superfluous. This option controls if
  ``constexpr`` should be added anyways. Default is ``false``.

.. option:: ConstexprString

  The string to use to specify a variable or function as ``constexpr``, for
  example, a macro. Default is ``constexpr``.

.. option:: ConstexprString

  The string to use with C++23 to specify a function-local variable as 
  ``static constexpr``, for example, a macro. Default is ``static constexpr``
  (concatenating ``static`` with the `ConstexprString` option).
