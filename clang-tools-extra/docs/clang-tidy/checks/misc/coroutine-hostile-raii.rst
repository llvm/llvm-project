misc-coroutine-hostile-raii
===========================

Detects when objects of certain hostile RAII types persists across suspension
points in a coroutine. Such hostile types include scoped-lockable types and
types belonging to a configurable denylist.

Some objects require that they be destroyed on the same thread that created them.
Traditionally this requirement was often phrased as "must be a local variable",
under the assumption that local variables always work this way. However this is
incorrect with C++20 coroutines, since an intervening ``co_await`` may cause the
coroutine to suspend and later be resumed on another thread.

The lifetime of an object that requires being destroyed on the same thread must
not encompass a ``co_await`` or ``co_yield`` point. If you create/destroy an object,
you must do so without allowing the coroutine to suspend in the meantime.

Following types are considered as hostile:

 - Scoped-lockable types: A scoped-lockable object persisting across a suspension
   point is problematic as the lock held by this object could be unlocked by a
   different thread. This would be undefined behaviour.
   This includes all types annotated with the ``scoped_lockable`` attribute.

 - Types belonging to a configurable denylist.

.. code-block:: c++

  // Call some async API while holding a lock.
  {
    const my::MutexLock l(&mu_);

    // Oops! The async Bar function may finish on a different
    // thread from the one that created the MutexLock object and therefore called
    // Mutex::Lock -- now Mutex::Unlock will be called on the wrong thread.
    co_await Bar();
  }


Options
-------

.. option:: RAIITypesList

    A semicolon-separated list of qualified types which should not be allowed to
    persist across suspension points.
    Eg: ``my::lockable; a::b;::my::other::lockable;``
    The default value of this option is `"std::lock_guard;std::scoped_lock"`.
