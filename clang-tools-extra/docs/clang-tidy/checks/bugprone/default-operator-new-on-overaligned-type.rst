bugprone-default-operator-new-on-overaligned-type
=================================================

Flags uses of default ``operator new`` where the type has extended
alignment (an alignment greater than the fundamental alignment).

The default ``operator new`` is guaranteed to provide the correct alignment if the
requested alignment is less or equal to the fundamental alignment.
Only cases are detected (by design) where the ``operator new`` is not
user-defined and is not a placement new (the reason is that in these cases we
assume that the user provided the correct memory allocation).
