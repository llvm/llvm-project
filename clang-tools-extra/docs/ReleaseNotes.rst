What's New in Extra Clang Tools |release|?
==========================================

Some of the major new features and improvements to Extra Clang Tools are listed
here. Generic improvements to Extra Clang Tools as a whole or to its underlying
infrastructure are described first, followed by tool-specific sections.

Major New Features
------------------

Potentially Breaking Changes
----------------------------

- Removed :program:`clang-tidy`'s global options `IgnoreMacros` and
  `StrictMode`, which were documented as deprecated since
  :program:`clang-tidy-20`. Users should use the check-specific options of the
  same name instead.

- Renamed :program:`clang-tidy`'s option name of check
  :doc:`bugprone-easily-swappable-parameters
  <clang-tidy/checks/bugprone/easily-swappable-parameters>` from
  ``NamePrefixSuffixSilenceDissimilarityTreshold`` to
  ``NamePrefixSuffixSilenceDissimilarityThreshold``,
  correcting a spelling mistake.

Improvements to clangd
----------------------

Inlay hints
^^^^^^^^^^^

Diagnostics
^^^^^^^^^^^

Semantic Highlighting
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Compile flags
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Hover
^^^^^

Code completion
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Code actions
^^^^^^^^^^^^

- New ``Override pure virtual methods`` code action. When invoked on a class
  definition, this action automatically generates C++ ``override`` declarations
  for all pure virtual methods inherited from its base classes that have not yet
  been implemented. The generated method stubs prompts the user for the actual
  implementation. The overrides are intelligently grouped under their original
  access specifiers (e.g., ``public``, ``protected``), creating new access
  specifier blocks if necessary.

Signature help
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Cross-references
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Objective-C
^^^^^^^^^^^

Miscellaneous
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Improvements to clang-doc
-------------------------

Improvements to clang-query
---------------------------

- Matcher queries interpreted by clang-query are now support trailing comma (,)
  in matcher arguments. Note that C++ still doesn't allow this in function
  arguments. So when porting a query to C++, remove all instances of trailing
  comma (otherwise C++ compiler will just complain about "expected expression").

Improvements to clang-tidy
--------------------------

- The :program:`check_clang_tidy.py` tool now recognizes the ``-std`` argument
  when run over C files. If ``-std`` is not specified, it defaults to
  ``c99-or-later``.

- :program:`clang-tidy` no longer attemps to analyze code from system headers
  by default, greatly improving performance. This behavior is disabled if the
  `SystemHeaders` option is enabled.

- The :program:`run-clang-tidy.py` and :program:`clang-tidy-diff.py` scripts
  now run checks in parallel by default using all available hardware threads.
  Both scripts display the number of threads being used in their output.

- Improved :program:`run-clang-tidy.py` by adding a new option
  `enable-check-profile` to enable per-check timing profiles and print a
  report based on all analyzed files.

- Improved documentation of the `-line-filter` command-line flag of
  :program:`clang-tidy` and :program:`run-clang-tidy.py`.

- Improved :program:`clang-tidy` option `-quiet` by suppressing diagnostic
  count messages.

- Improved :program:`clang-tidy` by not crashing when an empty `directory`
  field is used in a compilation database; the current working directory
  will be used instead, and an error message will be printed.

- Removed :program:`clang-tidy`'s global options `IgnoreMacros` and
  `StrictMode`, which were documented as deprecated since
  :program:`clang-tidy-20`. Users should use the check-specific options of the
  same name instead.

- Improved :program:`run-clang-tidy.py` and :program:`clang-tidy-diff.py`
  scripts by adding the `-hide-progress` option to suppress progress and
  informational messages.

New checks
^^^^^^^^^^

- New :doc:`bugprone-invalid-enum-default-initialization
  <clang-tidy/checks/bugprone/invalid-enum-default-initialization>` check.

  Detects default initialization (to 0) of variables with ``enum`` type where
  the enum has no enumerator with value of 0.

- New :doc:`cppcoreguidelines-pro-bounds-avoid-unchecked-container-access
  <clang-tidy/checks/cppcoreguidelines/pro-bounds-avoid-unchecked-container-access>`
  check.

  Finds calls to ``operator[]`` in STL containers and suggests replacing them
  with safe alternatives.

- New :doc:`google-runtime-float
  <clang-tidy/checks/google/runtime-float>` check.

  Finds uses of ``long double`` and suggests against their use due to lack of
  portability.

- New :doc:`llvm-mlir-op-builder
  <clang-tidy/checks/llvm/use-new-mlir-op-builder>` check.

  Checks for uses of MLIR's old/to be deprecated ``OpBuilder::create<T>`` form
  and suggests using ``T::create`` instead.

- New :doc:`llvm-use-ranges
  <clang-tidy/checks/llvm/use-ranges>` check.

  Finds calls to STL library iterator algorithms that could be replaced with
  LLVM range-based algorithms from ``llvm/ADT/STLExtras.h``.

- New :doc:`misc-override-with-different-visibility
  <clang-tidy/checks/misc/override-with-different-visibility>` check.

  Finds virtual function overrides with different visibility than the function
  in the base class.

New check aliases
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Renamed :doc:`cert-err34-c <clang-tidy/checks/cert/err34-c>` to
  :doc:`bugprone-unchecked-string-to-number-conversion
  <clang-tidy/checks/bugprone/unchecked-string-to-number-conversion>`
  keeping initial check as an alias to the new one.

Changes in existing checks
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Improved :doc:`bugprone-easily-swappable-parameters
  <clang-tidy/checks/bugprone/easily-swappable-parameters>` check by
  correcting a spelling mistake on its option
  ``NamePrefixSuffixSilenceDissimilarityTreshold``.

- Improved :doc:`bugprone-infinite-loop
  <clang-tidy/checks/bugprone/infinite-loop>` check by adding detection for
  variables introduced by structured bindings.

- Improved :doc:`bugprone-narrowing-conversions
  <clang-tidy/checks/bugprone/narrowing-conversions>` check by fixing
  false positive from analysis of a conditional expression in C.

- Improved :doc:`bugprone-reserved-identifier

  declarations and macros in system headers.

- Improved :doc:`bugprone-signed-char-misuse
  <clang-tidy/checks/bugprone/signed-char-misuse>` check by fixing
  false positives on C23 enums with the fixed underlying type of signed char.

- Improved :doc:`bugprone-tagged-union-member-count
  <clang-tidy/checks/bugprone/tagged-union-member-count>` by fixing a false
  positive when enums or unions from system header files or the ``std``
  namespace are treated as the tag or the data part of a user-defined
  tagged union respectively.

- Improved :doc:`bugprone-unchecked-optional-access
  <clang-tidy/checks/bugprone/unchecked-optional-access>` check by supporting
  ``NullableValue::makeValue`` and ``NullableValue::makeValueInplace`` to
  prevent false-positives for ``BloombergLP::bdlb::NullableValue`` type.

- Improved :doc:`bugprone-unhandled-self-assignment
  <clang-tidy/checks/bugprone/unhandled-self-assignment>` check by adding
  an additional matcher that generalizes the copy-and-swap idiom pattern
  detection.

- Improved :doc:`cppcoreguidelines-prefer-member-initializer
  <clang-tidy/checks/cppcoreguidelines/prefer-member-initializer>` check to
  avoid false positives on inherited members in class templates.

- Improved :doc:`cppcoreguidelines-pro-bounds-pointer-arithmetic
  <clang-tidy/checks/cppcoreguidelines/pro-bounds-pointer-arithmetic>` check
  adding an option to allow pointer arithmetic via prefix/postfix increment or
  decrement operators.

- Improved :doc:`llvm-prefer-isa-or-dyn-cast-in-conditionals
  <clang-tidy/checks/llvm/prefer-isa-or-dyn-cast-in-conditionals>` check:

  <clang-tidy/checks/misc/header-include-cycle>` check performance.

- Improved :doc:`modernize-avoid-c-arrays
  <clang-tidy/checks/modernize/avoid-c-arrays>` to not diagnose array types
  which are part of an implicit instantiation of a template.

- Improved :doc:`modernize-use-constraints
  <clang-tidy/checks/modernize/use-constraints>` check by fixing a crash on
  uses of non-standard ``enable_if`` with a signature different from
  ``std::enable_if`` (such as ``boost::enable_if``).

- Improved :doc:`modernize-use-designated-initializers
  <clang-tidy/checks/modernize/use-designated-initializers>` check to
  suggest using designated initializers for aliased aggregate types.

- Improved :doc:`modernize-use-std-format
  <clang-tidy/checks/modernize/use-std-format>` check to correctly match
  when the format string is converted to a different type by an implicit
  constructor call.

- Improved :doc:`modernize-use-std-print
  <clang-tidy/checks/modernize/use-std-print>` check to correctly match
  when the format string is converted to a different type by an implicit
  constructor call.

  <clang-tidy/checks/performance/unnecessary-copy-initialization>` by printing
  the type of the diagnosed variable.

- Improved :doc:`performance-unnecessary-value-param
  <clang-tidy/checks/performance/unnecessary-value-param>` by printing
  the type of the diagnosed variable.

- Improved :doc:`portability-template-virtual-member-function

  avoid false positives on pure virtual member functions.

- Improved :doc:`readability-container-size-empty
  <clang-tidy/checks/readability/container-size-empty>` check by correctly
  generating fix-it hints when size method is called from implicit ``this``,
  ignoring default constructors with user provided arguments and adding
  detection in container's method except ``empty``.

- Improved :doc:`readability-identifier-naming
  <clang-tidy/checks/readability/identifier-naming>` check by ignoring
  declarations and macros in system headers. The documentation is also improved
  to differentiate the general options from the specific ones.

- Improved :doc:`readability-qualified-auto
  <clang-tidy/checks/readability/qualified-auto>` check by adding the option
  `IgnoreAliasing`, that allows not looking at underlying types of type aliases.

- Improved :doc:`readability-uppercase-literal-suffix
