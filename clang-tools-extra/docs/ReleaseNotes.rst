Introduction
============

This document contains the release notes for the Extra Clang Tools, part of the
Clang release 13.0.0. Here we describe the status of the Extra Clang Tools in
some detail, including major improvements from the previous release and new
feature work. All LLVM releases may be downloaded from the `LLVM releases web
site <https://llvm.org/releases/>`_.

For more information about Clang or LLVM, including information about
the latest release, please see the `Clang Web Site <https://clang.llvm.org>`_ or
the `LLVM Web Site <https://llvm.org>`_.

Note that if you are reading this file from a Git checkout or the
main Clang web page, this document applies to the *next* release, not
the current one. To see the release notes for a specific release, please

What's New in Extra Clang Tools 13.0.0?
=======================================

Some of the major new features and improvements to Extra Clang Tools are listed
here. Generic improvements to Extra Clang Tools as a whole or to its underlying
infrastructure are described first, followed by tool-specific sections.

Improvements to clang-tidy
--------------------------

- The `run-clang-tidy.py` helper script is now installed in `bin/` as
  `run-clang-tidy`. It was previously installed in `share/clang/`.

- Added command line option `--fix-notes` to apply fixes found in notes
  attached to warnings. These are typically cases where we are less confident
  the fix will have the desired effect.

- libToolingCore and Clang-Tidy was refactored and now checks can produce
  highlights (`^~~~~` under fragments of the source code) in diagnostics.
  Existing and new checks in the future can be expected to start implementing
  this functionality.
  This change only affects the visual rendering of diagnostics, and does not
  alter the behavior of generated fixes.

New checks
^^^^^^^^^^

- New :doc:`bugprone-implicit-widening-of-multiplication-result
  <clang-tidy/checks/bugprone-implicit-widening-of-multiplication-result>` check.

  Diagnoses instances of an implicit widening of multiplication result.

- New :doc:`concurrency-thread-canceltype-asynchronous
  <clang-tidy/checks/concurrency-thread-canceltype-asynchronous>` check.

  Finds ``pthread_setcanceltype`` function calls where a thread's cancellation
  type is set to asynchronous.

- New :doc:`altera-id-dependent-backward-branch
  <clang-tidy/checks/altera-id-dependent-backward-branch>` check.

  Finds ID-dependent variables and fields that are used within loops. This
  causes branches to occur inside the loops, and thus leads to performance
  degradation.

- New :doc:`altera-unroll-loops
  <clang-tidy/checks/altera-unroll-loops>` check.

  Finds inner loops that have not been unrolled, as well as fully unrolled
  loops with unknown loops bounds or a large number of iterations.

- New :doc:`bugprone-easily-swappable-parameters
  <clang-tidy/checks/bugprone-easily-swappable-parameters>` check.

  Finds function definitions where parameters of convertible types follow each
  other directly, making call sites prone to calling the function with
  swapped (or badly ordered) arguments.

- New :doc:`cppcoreguidelines-prefer-member-initializer
  <clang-tidy/checks/cppcoreguidelines-prefer-member-initializer>` check.

  Finds member initializations in the constructor body which can be placed into
  the initialization list instead.

- New :doc:`bugprone-unhandled-exception-at-new
  <clang-tidy/checks/bugprone-unhandled-exception-at-new>` check.

  Finds calls to ``new`` with missing exception handler for ``std::bad_alloc``.

- New `readability-suspicious-call-argument
  <clang-tidy/checks/readability-suspicious-call-argument>`_ check

  Finds function calls where the arguments passed are provided out of order,
  based on the difference between the argument name and the parameter names
  of the function.

New check aliases
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- New alias :doc:`cert-pos47-c
  <clang-tidy/checks/cert-pos47-c>` to
  :doc:`concurrency-thread-canceltype-asynchronous
  <clang-tidy/checks/concurrency-thread-canceltype-asynchronous>` was added.


Changes in existing checks
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Improved :doc:`bugprone-signal-handler
  <clang-tidy/checks/bugprone-signal-handler>` check.

  Added an option to choose the set of allowed functions.

- Improved :doc:`readability-uniqueptr-delete-release
  <clang-tidy/checks/readability-uniqueptr-delete-release>` check.

  Added an option to choose whether to refactor by calling the ``reset`` member
  function or assignment to ``nullptr``.
  Added support for pointers to ``std::unique_ptr``.

Removed checks
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- The readability-deleted-default check has been removed.
  
  The clang warning `Wdefaulted-function-deleted
  <https://clang.llvm.org/docs/DiagnosticsReference.html#wdefaulted-function-deleted>`_
  will diagnose the same issues and is enabled by default.
