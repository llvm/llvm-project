What's New in Extra Clang Tools 14.0.0?
=======================================

Some of the major new features and improvements to Extra Clang Tools are listed
here. Generic improvements to Extra Clang Tools as a whole or to its underlying
infrastructure are described first, followed by tool-specific sections.

Major New Features
------------------

...

Improvements to clangd
----------------------

Inlay hints
^^^^^^^^^^^

- This feature provides texutal hints interleaved with the code,
  like parameter names, deduced types and designated initializers.

- The `clangd/inlayHints <https://clangd.llvm.org/extensions#inlay-hints>`_
  LSP extension is now documented, and both position and range.

- Inlay hints are now on-by-default in clangd, if the client supports and
  exposes them. (`vscode-clangd
  <https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=llvm-vs-code-extensions.vscode-clangd>`_
  does so). The ``-inlay-hints`` flag has been removed.

- Inlay hints can be `disabled or configured
  <https://clangd.llvm.org/config#inlayhints>`_ in the config file.

Diagnostics
^^^^^^^^^^^

- `Unused #include
  <https://clangd.llvm.org/design/include-cleaner>`_ diagnostics are available.
  These are off by default, and can be turned on through the
  `Diagnostics.UnusedIncludes <https://clangd.llvm.org/config#unusedincludes>`_
  config option.

- ``Deprecated`` and ``Unnecessary`` tags from LSP 3.15 are set on
  ``-Wdeprecated`` and ``-Wunused`` diagnostics. Clients may display these
  in a specialized way.

- clangd suggests inserting includes to fix problems in more cases:

  - calling unknown functions in C, even when an implicit declaration is
    inferred.
  - incomplete types (some additional cases).
  - various diagnostics that specify "include <foo.h>" in their text.

- The "populate switch" action is more reliably offered as a fix for
  ``-Wswitch`` warnings, and works with C enums.

- Warnings specified by ``ExtraArgs: -W...`` flags in ``.clang-tidy`` config
  files are now produced.

Semantic Highlighting
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- ``virtual`` modifier for method names
- ``usedAsMutableReference`` modifier for function parameters
- Lambda captures now marked as local variables.

Compile flags
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Compile flags like ``-xc++-header`` that must precede input file names are now
  added correctly by the
  `CompileFlags.Add <https://clangd.llvm.org/config#add>`_ config option.

- If multiple architectures are specified (e.g. when targeting Apple M1+Intel),
  clangd will now use the host architecture instead of failing to parse.

- Added `CompileFlags.Compiler <https://clangd.llvm.org/config#compiler>`_
  option to override executable name in compile flags.

- Copying ``compile_commands.json`` entries from one file to another (and simply
  adjusting ``file``) should now work correctly.

Hover
^^^^^

- Hovering on many attributes (e.g. ``[[nodiscard]]``) will show documentation.
- Hovering on include directives shows the resolved header path.
- Hovering on character literals shows their numeric value.
- Code snippets are marked with the appropriate language instead of always C++.
  This may improve clients' syntax highlighting.
- Include desugared types in hover, like in diagnostics.
  Off by default, controlled with `Hover.ShowAKA
  <https://clangd.llvm.org/config#showaka>`_ config option.

Code completion
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Completion of attributes (e.g. ``[[gsl::Owner(Foo)]]``)
- Completion of ``/*ParameterName=*/`` comments.
- Documentation of items with ``annotate`` attributes now includes the
  annotation.
- Improved handling of results with 1-3 character names.
- Completion of members in constructor init lists (``Foo() : member_() {}``) is
  much more reliable.
- C++ Standard library completions should be less noisy: parameter names are
  deuglified (``vector<_Tp>`` is now ``vector<Tp>``) and many
  ``__implementation_details`` are hidden altogether.

Signature help
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Signatures for template argument lists
- Signatures for braced constructor calls
- Signatures for aggregate initializers
- Signatures for members in constructor init lists are much more reliable.
- Variadic functions correctly show signature help when typing the variadic
  arguments.
- Signature help is retriggered on closing brackets ``)``, ``}``, ``>``.
  This means signature help should be correct after nested function calls.

Cross-references
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Support for ``textDocument/typeDefinition`` LSP request.
- Improved handling of symbols introduced via using declarations.
- Searching for references to an overriding method also returns references to
  the base class method. (Typically calls that may invoke the override).
- All references from the current file are always returned, even if there are
  enough to exceed our usual limit.

Objective-C
^^^^^^^^^^^

- ``#pragma mark`` directives now form groups in the document outline.
- ``id`` and ``instancetype`` are treated as keywords rather than typedefs

Miscellaneous
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Include request context on crashes when possible.
- Many stability, performance and correctness improvements.
- ``-use-dirty-headers`` command line flag to use dirty buffer contents when
  parsing headers, rather than the saved on-disk contents.
- ``clangd --check=/path/to/file.cpp`` now reads config files in ancestor
  directories, in addition to user config file.
- Improved compile flags handling in ``clangd-indexer``.
- The index file format changed in this release, indexes need to be rebuilt.
  This should happen transparently in standard cases (the background index).

Improvements to clang-doc

Improvements to clang-tidy
--------------------------

- Ignore warnings from macros defined in system headers, if not using the
  `-system-headers` flag.

- Added support for globbing in `NOLINT*` expressions, to simplify suppressing
  multiple warnings in the same line.

- Added support for `NOLINTBEGIN` ... `NOLINTEND` comments to suppress
  Clang-Tidy warnings over multiple lines.

New checks
^^^^^^^^^^

- New :doc:`abseil-cleanup-ctad
  <clang-tidy/checks/abseil-cleanup-ctad>` check.

  Suggests switching the initialization pattern of ``absl::Cleanup``
  instances from the factory function to class template argument
  deduction (CTAD), in C++17 and higher.

- New :doc:`bugprone-stringview-nullptr
  <clang-tidy/checks/bugprone-stringview-nullptr>` check.

  Checks for various ways that the ``const CharT*`` constructor of
  ``std::basic_string_view`` can be passed a null argument.

- New :doc:`bugprone-suspicious-memory-comparison
  <clang-tidy/checks/bugprone-suspicious-memory-comparison>` check.

  Finds potentially incorrect calls to ``memcmp()`` based on properties of the
  arguments.

- New :doc:`cppcoreguidelines-virtual-class-destructor
  <clang-tidy/checks/cppcoreguidelines-virtual-class-destructor>` check.

  Finds virtual classes whose destructor is neither public and virtual nor
  protected and non-virtual.

- New :doc:`misc-misleading-bidirectional <clang-tidy/checks/misc-misleading-bidirectional>` check.

  Inspects string literal and comments for unterminated bidirectional Unicode
  characters.

- New :doc:`misc-misleading-identifier <clang-tidy/checks/misc-misleading-identifier>` check.

  Reports identifier with unicode right-to-left characters.

- New :doc:`readability-container-contains
  <clang-tidy/checks/readability-container-contains>` check.

  Finds usages of ``container.count()`` and ``container.find() == container.end()`` which should
  be replaced by a call to the ``container.contains()`` method introduced in C++20.

- New :doc:`readability-container-data-pointer
  <clang-tidy/checks/readability-container-data-pointer>` check.

  Finds cases where code could use ``data()`` rather than the address of the
  element at index 0 in a container.

- New :doc:`readability-duplicate-include
  <clang-tidy/checks/readability-duplicate-include>` check.

  Looks for duplicate includes and removes them.

- New :doc:`readability-identifier-length
  <clang-tidy/checks/readability-identifier-length>` check.

  Reports identifiers whose names are too short. Currently checks local
  variables and function parameters only.

New check aliases
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- New alias :doc:`cert-err33-c
  <clang-tidy/checks/cert-err33-c>` to
  :doc:`bugprone-unused-return-value
  <clang-tidy/checks/bugprone-unused-return-value>` was added.

- New alias :doc:`cert-exp42-c
  <clang-tidy/checks/cert-exp42-c>` to
  :doc:`bugprone-suspicious-memory-comparison
  <clang-tidy/checks/bugprone-suspicious-memory-comparison>` was added.

- New alias :doc:`cert-flp37-c
  <clang-tidy/checks/cert-flp37-c>` to
  :doc:`bugprone-suspicious-memory-comparison
  <clang-tidy/checks/bugprone-suspicious-memory-comparison>` was added.

Changes in existing checks
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- :doc:`bugprone-assert-side-effect
  <clang-tidy/checks/bugprone-assert-side-effect>` check now supports an
  ``IgnoredFunctions`` option to explicitly consider the specified
  semicolon-separated functions list as not having any side-effects.
  Regular expressions for the list items are also accepted.

- Fixed a false positive in :doc:`bugprone-throw-keyword-missing
  <clang-tidy/checks/bugprone-throw-keyword-missing>` when creating an
  exception object using placement new.

- Removed default setting ``cppcoreguidelines-explicit-virtual-functions.IgnoreDestructors = "true"``,
  from :doc:`cppcoreguidelines-explicit-virtual-functions
  <clang-tidy/checks/cppcoreguidelines-explicit-virtual-functions>`
  to match the current state of the C++ Core Guidelines.

- Eliminated false positives for :doc:`cppcoreguidelines-macro-usage
  <clang-tidy/checks/cppcoreguidelines-macro-usage>` by restricting
  the warning about using constants to only macros that expand to literals.

- :doc:`cppcoreguidelines-narrowing-conversions
  <clang-tidy/checks/cppcoreguidelines-narrowing-conversions>`
  check now supports a ``WarnOnIntegerToFloatingPointNarrowingConversion``
  option to control whether to warn on narrowing integer to floating-point
  conversions.

- Make the :doc:`cppcoreguidelines-pro-bounds-array-to-pointer-decay
  <clang-tidy/checks/cppcoreguidelines-pro-bounds-array-to-pointer-decay>`
  check accept string literal to pointer decay in conditional operator even
  if operands are of the same length.

- Removed suggestion ``use gsl::at`` from warning message in the
  :doc:`cppcoreguidelines-pro-bounds-constant-array-index
  <clang-tidy/checks/cppcoreguidelines-pro-bounds-constant-array-index>`
  check, since that is not a requirement from the C++ Core Guidelines.
  This allows people to choose their own safe indexing strategy. The
  fix-it is kept for those who want to use the GSL library.

- Fixed a false positive in :doc:`fuchsia-trailing-return
  <clang-tidy/checks/fuchsia-trailing-return>` for C++17 deduction guides.

- Updated :doc:`google-readability-casting
  <clang-tidy/checks/google-readability-casting>` to diagnose and fix
  functional casts, to achieve feature parity with the corresponding
  ``cpplint.py`` check.

- Generalized the :doc:`modernize-use-default-member-init
  <clang-tidy/checks/modernize-use-default-member-init>` check to handle
  non-default constructors.

- Improved :doc:`performance-move-const-arg
  <clang-tidy/checks/performance-move-const-arg>` check.

  Removed a wrong FixIt for trivially copyable objects wrapped by
  ``std::move()`` and passed to an rvalue reference parameter. Removal of
  ``std::move()`` would break the code.

- :doc:`readability-simplify-boolean-expr
  <clang-tidy/checks/readability-simplify-boolean-expr>` now simplifies
  return statements associated with ``case``, ``default`` and labeled
  statements.
