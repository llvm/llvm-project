New checks
^^^^^^^^^^

- New :doc:`bugprone-unintended-char-ostream-output
  <clang-tidy/checks/bugprone/unintended-char-ostream-output>` check.

  Finds unintended character output from ``unsigned char`` and ``signed char`` to an
  ``ostream``.

New check aliases
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Changes in existing checks
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Improved :doc:`bugprone-string-constructor
  <clang-tidy/checks/bugprone/string-constructor>` check to find suspicious
  calls of ``std::string`` constructor with char pointer, start position and
  length parameters.

- Improved :doc:`bugprone-unchecked-optional-access
  <clang-tidy/checks/bugprone/unchecked-optional-access>` fixing false
  positives from smart pointer accessors repeated in checking ``has_value``
  and accessing ``value``. The option `IgnoreSmartPointerDereference` should
  no longer be needed and will be removed.

- Improved :doc:`bugprone-unsafe-functions
  <clang-tidy/checks/bugprone/unsafe-functions>` check to allow specifying
  additional C++ member functions to match.

- Improved :doc:`misc-const-correctness
  <clang-tidy/checks/misc/const-correctness>` check by adding the option
  `AllowedTypes`, that excludes specified types from const-correctness
  checking.

- Improved :doc:`misc-redundant-expression
  <clang-tidy/checks/misc/redundant-expression>` check by providing additional
  examples and fixing some macro related false positives.

- Improved :doc:`performance/unnecessary-value-param
  <clang-tidy/checks/performance/unnecessary-value-param>` check performance by
  tolerating fix-it breaking compilation when functions is used as pointers 
  to avoid matching usage of functions within the current compilation unit.

- Improved :doc:`performance-move-const-arg
  <clang-tidy/checks/performance/move-const-arg>` check by fixing false negatives
  on ternary operators calling ``std::move``.
