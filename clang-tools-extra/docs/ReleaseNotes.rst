Improvements to clang-tidy
--------------------------

- Preprocessor-level module header parsing is now disabled by default due to
  the problems it caused in C++20 and above, leading to performance and code
  parsing issues regardless of whether modules were used or not. This change
  will impact only the following checks:
  :doc:`modernize-replace-disallow-copy-and-assign-macro
  <clang-tidy/checks/modernize/replace-disallow-copy-and-assign-macro>`,
  :doc:`bugprone-reserved-identifier
  <clang-tidy/checks/bugprone/reserved-identifier>`, and
  :doc:`readability-identifier-naming
  <clang-tidy/checks/readability/identifier-naming>`. Those checks will no
  longer see macros defined in modules. Users can still enable this
  functionality using the newly added command line option
  `--enable-module-headers-parsing`.

- Remove configuration option `AnalyzeTemporaryDestructors`, which was deprecated since
  :program:`clang-tidy` 16.

- Improved `--dump-config` to print check options in alphabetical order.

- Improved :program:`clang-tidy-diff.py` script. It now returns exit code `1`
  if any :program:`clang-tidy` subprocess exits with a non-zero code or if
  exporting fixes fails.

New checks
^^^^^^^^^^

- New :doc:`bugprone-compare-pointer-to-member-virtual-function
  <clang-tidy/checks/bugprone/compare-pointer-to-member-virtual-function>` check.

  Detects equality comparison between pointer to member virtual function and
  anything other than null-pointer-constant.

- New :doc:`bugprone-inc-dec-in-conditions
  <clang-tidy/checks/bugprone/inc-dec-in-conditions>` check.

  Detects when a variable is both incremented/decremented and referenced inside
  a complex condition and suggests moving them outside to avoid ambiguity in
  the variable's value.

- New :doc:`bugprone-incorrect-enable-if
  <clang-tidy/checks/bugprone/incorrect-enable-if>` check.

  Detects incorrect usages of ``std::enable_if`` that don't name the nested
  ``type`` type.

- New :doc:`bugprone-multi-level-implicit-pointer-conversion
  <clang-tidy/checks/bugprone/multi-level-implicit-pointer-conversion>` check.

  Detects implicit conversions between pointers of different levels of
  indirection.

- New :doc:`bugprone-optional-value-conversion
  <clang-tidy/checks/bugprone/optional-value-conversion>` check.

  Detects potentially unintentional and redundant conversions where a value is
  extracted from an optional-like type and then used to create a new instance
  of the same optional-like type.

- New :doc:`cppcoreguidelines-no-suspend-with-lock
  <clang-tidy/checks/cppcoreguidelines/no-suspend-with-lock>` check.

  Flags coroutines that suspend while a lock guard is in scope at the
  suspension point.

- New :doc:`modernize-use-constraints
  <clang-tidy/checks/modernize/use-constraints>` check.

  Replace ``enable_if`` with C++20 requires clauses.

- New :doc:`performance-enum-size
  <clang-tidy/checks/performance/enum-size>` check.

  Recommends the smallest possible underlying type for an ``enum`` or ``enum``
  class based on the range of its enumerators.

- New :doc:`readability-reference-to-constructed-temporary
  <clang-tidy/checks/readability/reference-to-constructed-temporary>` check.

  Detects C++ code where a reference variable is used to extend the lifetime
  of a temporary object that has just been constructed.

New check aliases
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- New alias :doc:`cppcoreguidelines-macro-to-enum
  <clang-tidy/checks/cppcoreguidelines/macro-to-enum>` to :doc:`modernize-macro-to-enum
  <clang-tidy/checks/modernize/macro-to-enum>` was added.

Changes in existing checks
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Improved :doc:`bugprone-lambda-function-name
  <clang-tidy/checks/bugprone/lambda-function-name>` check by adding option
  `IgnoreMacros` to ignore warnings in macros.

- Improved :doc:`bugprone-non-zero-enum-to-bool-conversion
  <clang-tidy/checks/bugprone/non-zero-enum-to-bool-conversion>` check by
  eliminating false positives resulting from direct usage of bitwise operators.

- Improved :doc:`bugprone-reserved-identifier
  <clang-tidy/checks/bugprone/reserved-identifier>` check, so that it does not
  warn on macros starting with underscore and lowercase letter.

- Improved :doc:`bugprone-undefined-memory-manipulation
  <clang-tidy/checks/bugprone/undefined-memory-manipulation>` check to support
  fixed-size arrays of non-trivial types.

- Improved :doc:`cppcoreguidelines-avoid-non-const-global-variables
  <clang-tidy/checks/cppcoreguidelines/avoid-non-const-global-variables>` check
  to ignore ``static`` variables declared within the scope of
  ``class``/``struct``.

- Improved :doc:`cppcoreguidelines-avoid-reference-coroutine-parameters
  <clang-tidy/checks/cppcoreguidelines/avoid-reference-coroutine-parameters>`
  check to ignore false positives related to matching parameters of non
  coroutine functions and increase issue detection for cases involving type
  aliases with references.

- Improved :doc:`cppcoreguidelines-prefer-member-initializer
  <clang-tidy/checks/cppcoreguidelines/prefer-member-initializer>` check to
  ignore delegate constructors.

- Improved :doc:`cppcoreguidelines-pro-bounds-array-to-pointer-decay
  <clang-tidy/checks/cppcoreguidelines/pro-bounds-array-to-pointer-decay>` check
  to ignore predefined expression (e.g., ``__func__``, ...).

- Improved :doc:`cppcoreguidelines-pro-bounds-constant-array-index
  <clang-tidy/checks/cppcoreguidelines/pro-bounds-constant-array-index>` check
  to perform checks on derived classes of  ``std::array``.

- Improved :doc:`cppcoreguidelines-pro-type-member-init
  <clang-tidy/checks/cppcoreguidelines/pro-type-member-init>` check to ignore
  dependent delegate constructors.

- Improved :doc:`cppcoreguidelines-pro-type-vararg
  <clang-tidy/checks/cppcoreguidelines/pro-type-vararg>` check to ignore
  false-positives in unevaluated context (e.g., ``decltype``, ``sizeof``, ...).

- Improved :doc:`cppcoreguidelines-rvalue-reference-param-not-moved
  <clang-tidy/checks/cppcoreguidelines/rvalue-reference-param-not-moved>` check
  to ignore unused parameters when they are marked as unused.

- Improved :doc:`llvm-namespace-comment
  <clang-tidy/checks/llvm/namespace-comment>` check to provide fixes for
  ``inline`` namespaces in the same format as :program:`clang-format`.

- Improved :doc:`llvmlibc-callee-namespace
  <clang-tidy/checks/llvmlibc/callee-namespace>` to support
  customizable namespace. This matches the change made to implementation in
  namespace.

- Improved :doc:`llvmlibc-implementation-in-namespace
  <clang-tidy/checks/llvmlibc/implementation-in-namespace>` to support
  customizable namespace. This further allows for testing the libc when the
  system-libc is also LLVM's libc.

- Improved :doc:`misc-const-correctness
  <clang-tidy/checks/misc/const-correctness>` check to avoid false positive when
  using pointer to member function.

- Improved :doc:`misc-include-cleaner
  <clang-tidy/checks/misc/include-cleaner>` check by adding option
  `DeduplicateFindings` to output one finding per symbol occurrence, avoid
  inserting the same header multiple times, fix a bug where `IgnoreHeaders`
  option won't work with verbatim/std headers.

- Improved :doc:`misc-redundant-expression
  <clang-tidy/checks/misc/redundant-expression>` check to ignore
  false-positives in unevaluated context (e.g., ``decltype``).

- Improved :doc:`modernize-loop-convert
  <clang-tidy/checks/modernize/loop-convert>` to support for-loops with
  iterators initialized by free functions like ``begin``, ``end``, or ``size``
  and avoid crash for array of dependent array.

- Improved :doc:`modernize-return-braced-init-list
  <clang-tidy/checks/modernize/return-braced-init-list>` check to ignore
  false-positives when constructing the container with ``count`` copies of
  elements with value ``value``.

- Improved :doc:`modernize-use-equals-delete
  <clang-tidy/checks/modernize/use-equals-delete>` check to ignore
  false-positives when special member function is actually used or implicit.

- Improved :doc:`modernize-use-nullptr
  <clang-tidy/checks/modernize/use-nullptr>` check by adding option
  `IgnoredTypes` that can be used to exclude some pointer types.

- Improved :doc:`modernize-use-std-print
  <clang-tidy/checks/modernize/use-std-print>` check to accurately generate
  fixes for reordering arguments.

- Improved :doc:`modernize-use-using
  <clang-tidy/checks/modernize/use-using>` check to fix function pointer and
  forward declared ``typedef`` correctly.

- Improved :doc:`performance-faster-string-find
  <clang-tidy/checks/performance/faster-string-find>` check to properly escape
  single quotes.

- Improved :doc:`performance-noexcept-move-constructor
  <clang-tidy/checks/performance/noexcept-move-constructor>` to better handle
  conditional noexcept expressions, eliminating false-positives.

- Improved :doc:`performance-noexcept-swap
  <clang-tidy/checks/performance/noexcept-swap>` check to enforce a stricter
  match with the swap function signature and better handling of condition
  noexcept expressions, eliminating false-positives.

- Improved :doc:`readability-braces-around-statements
  <clang-tidy/checks/readability/braces-around-statements>` check to
  ignore false-positive for ``if constexpr`` in lambda expression.

- Improved :doc:`readability-container-size-empty
  <clang-tidy/checks/readability/container-size-empty>` check to
  detect comparison between string and empty string literals and support
  ``length()`` method as an alternative to ``size()``.

- Improved :doc:`readability-function-size
  <clang-tidy/checks/readability/function-size>` check configuration to use
  `none` rather than `-1` to disable some parameters.

- Improved :doc:`readability-identifier-naming
  <clang-tidy/checks/readability/identifier-naming>` check to issue accurate
  warnings when a type's forward declaration precedes its definition.
  Additionally, it now provides appropriate warnings for ``struct`` and
  ``union`` in C, while also incorporating support for the
  ``Leading_upper_snake_case`` naming convention. The handling of ``typedef``
  has been enhanced, particularly within complex types like function pointers
  and cases where style checks were omitted when functions started with macros.

- Improved :doc:`readability-implicit-bool-conversion
  <clang-tidy/checks/readability/implicit-bool-conversion>` check to take
  do-while loops into account for the `AllowIntegerConditions` and
  `AllowPointerConditions` options.

- Improved :doc:`readability-non-const-parameter
  <clang-tidy/checks/readability/non-const-parameter>` check to ignore
  false-positives in initializer list of record.
