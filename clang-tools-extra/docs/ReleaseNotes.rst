Improvements to clang-tidy
--------------------------

- Preprocessor-level module header parsing is now disabled by default due to
  the problems it caused in C++20 and above, leading to performance and code
  parsing issues regardless of whether modules were used or not. This change
  will impact only the following checks:
  :doc:`modernize-replace-disallow-copy-and-assign-macro
  <clang-tidy/checks/modernize/replace-disallow-copy-and-assign-macro>`,
  :doc:`bugprone-reserved-identifier
  <clang-tidy/checks/bugprone/reserved-identifier>`, and
  :doc:`readability-identifier-naming
  <clang-tidy/checks/readability/identifier-naming>`. Those checks will no
  longer see macros defined in modules. Users can still enable this
  functionality using the newly added command line option
  `--enable-module-headers-parsing`.

- Remove configuration option `AnalyzeTemporaryDestructors`, which was deprecated since
  :program:`clang-tidy` 16.

- Improved `--dump-config` to print check options in alphabetical order.

New checks
^^^^^^^^^^

- New :doc:`bugprone-multi-level-implicit-pointer-conversion
  <clang-tidy/checks/bugprone/multi-level-implicit-pointer-conversion>` check.

  Detects implicit conversions between pointers of different levels of
  indirection.

- New :doc:`performance-enum-size
  <clang-tidy/checks/performance/enum-size>` check.

  Recommends the smallest possible underlying type for an ``enum`` or ``enum``
  class based on the range of its enumerators.

- New :doc:`readability-reference-to-constructed-temporary
  <clang-tidy/checks/readability/reference-to-constructed-temporary>` check.

  Detects C++ code where a reference variable is used to extend the lifetime
  of a temporary object that has just been constructed.

New check aliases
