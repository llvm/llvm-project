New module
^^^^^^^^^^
- New module `llvmlibc`.

  This module contains checks related to the LLVM-libc coding standards.

New checks
^^^^^^^^^^
- New :doc:`cppcoreguidelines-avoid-non-const-global-variables
  <clang-tidy/checks/cppcoreguidelines-avoid-non-const-global-variables>` check.
  Finds non-const global variables as described in check I.2 of C++ Core
  Guidelines.

- New :doc:`bugprone-misplaced-pointer-arithmetic-in-alloc
  <clang-tidy/checks/bugprone-misplaced-pointer-arithmetic-in-alloc>` check.

  Finds cases where an integer expression is added to or subtracted from the
  result of a memory allocation function (``malloc()``, ``calloc()``,
  ``realloc()``, ``alloca()``) instead of its argument.

- New :doc:`bugprone-spuriously-wake-up-functions
  <clang-tidy/checks/bugprone-spuriously-wake-up-functions>` check.

  Finds ``cnd_wait``, ``cnd_timedwait``, ``wait``, ``wait_for``, or
  ``wait_until`` function calls when the function is not invoked from a loop
  that checks whether a condition predicate holds or the function has a
  condition parameter.

- New :doc:`bugprone-reserved-identifier
  <clang-tidy/checks/bugprone-reserved-identifier>` check.

  Checks for usages of identifiers reserved for use by the implementation.

- New :doc:`bugprone-suspicious-include
  <clang-tidy/checks/bugprone-suspicious-include>` check.

  Finds cases where an include refers to what appears to be an implementation
  file, which often leads to hard-to-track-down ODR violations, and diagnoses
  them.

- New :doc:`cert-oop57-cpp
  <clang-tidy/checks/cert-oop57-cpp>` check.

  Flags use of the `C` standard library functions ``memset``, ``memcpy`` and
  ``memcmp`` and similar derivatives on non-trivial types.

- New :doc:`llvmlibc-implementation-in-namespace
  <clang-tidy/checks/llvmlibc-implementation-in-namespace>` check.

  Checks all llvm-libc implementation is within the correct namespace.

- New :doc:`llvmlibc-restrict-system-libc-headers
  <clang-tidy/checks/llvmlibc-restrict-system-libc-headers>` check.

  Finds includes of system libc headers not provided by the compiler within
  llvm-libc implementations.

- New :doc:`objc-dealloc-in-category
  <clang-tidy/checks/objc-dealloc-in-category>` check.

  Finds implementations of -dealloc in Objective-C categories.

- New :doc:`misc-no-recursion
  <clang-tidy/checks/misc-no-recursion>` check.

  Finds recursive functions and diagnoses them.

- New :doc:`objc-nsinvocation-argument-lifetime
  <clang-tidy/checks/objc-nsinvocation-argument-lifetime>` check.

  Finds calls to ``NSInvocation`` methods under ARC that don't have proper
  argument object lifetimes.

New check aliases
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- New alias :doc:`cert-con36-c
  <clang-tidy/checks/cert-con36-c>` to
  :doc:`bugprone-spuriously-wake-up-functions
  <clang-tidy/checks/bugprone-spuriously-wake-up-functions>` was added.

- New alias :doc:`cert-con54-cpp
  <clang-tidy/checks/cert-con54-cpp>` to
  :doc:`bugprone-spuriously-wake-up-functions
  <clang-tidy/checks/bugprone-spuriously-wake-up-functions>` was added.

- New alias :doc:`cert-dcl37-c
  <clang-tidy/checks/cert-dcl37-c>` to
  :doc:`bugprone-reserved-identifier
  <clang-tidy/checks/bugprone-reserved-identifier>` was added.

- New alias :doc:`cert-dcl51-cpp
  <clang-tidy/checks/cert-dcl51-cpp>` to
  :doc:`bugprone-reserved-identifier
  <clang-tidy/checks/bugprone-reserved-identifier>` was added.

Changes in existing checks
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Improved :doc:`readability-qualified-auto
  <clang-tidy/checks/readability-qualified-auto>` check now supports a
  `AddConstToQualified` to enable adding ``const`` qualifiers to variables
  typed with ``auto *`` and ``auto &``.

- Improved :doc:`readability-redundant-string-init
  <clang-tidy/checks/readability-redundant-string-init>` check now supports a
  `StringNames` option enabling its application to custom string classes. The
  check now detects in class initializers and constructor initializers which
  are deemed to be redundant.

- Checks supporting the ``HeaderFileExtensions`` flag now support ``;`` as a
  delimiter in addition to ``,``, with the latter being deprecated as of this
  release. This simplifies how one specifies the options on the command line:
  ``--config="{CheckOptions: [{ key: HeaderFileExtensions, value: h;;hpp;hxx }]}"``

Renamed checks
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- The 'fuchsia-restrict-system-headers' check was renamed to :doc:`portability-restrict-system-includes
  <clang-tidy/checks/portability-restrict-system-includes>`
