New checks
^^^^^^^^^^

- New :doc:`readability-use-std-min-max
  <clang-tidy/checks/readability/use-std-min-max>` check.

  Replaces certain conditional statements with equivalent calls to
  ``std::min`` or ``std::max``.

New check aliases
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Changes in existing checks
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Improved :doc:`bugprone-non-zero-enum-to-bool-conversion
  <clang-tidy/checks/bugprone/non-zero-enum-to-bool-conversion>` check by
  eliminating false positives resulting from direct usage of bitwise operators
  within parentheses.

- Improved :doc:`bugprone-suspicious-include
  <clang-tidy/checks/bugprone/suspicious-include>` check by replacing the local
  options `HeaderFileExtensions` and `ImplementationFileExtensions` by the
  global options of the same name.

- Improved :doc:`bugprone-too-small-loop-variable
  <clang-tidy/checks/bugprone/too-small-loop-variable>` check by incorporating
  better support for ``const`` loop boundaries.

- Improved :doc:`bugprone-unused-local-non-trivial-variable
  <clang-tidy/checks/bugprone/unused-local-non-trivial-variable>` check by
  ignoring local variable with ``[maybe_unused]`` attribute.

- Cleaned up :doc:`cppcoreguidelines-prefer-member-initializer
  <clang-tidy/checks/cppcoreguidelines/prefer-member-initializer>`
  by removing enforcement of rule `C.48
  <https://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines#c48-prefer-in-class-initializers-to-member-initializers-in-constructors-for-constant-initializers>`_,
  which was deprecated since :program:`clang-tidy` 17. This rule is now covered
  by :doc:`cppcoreguidelines-use-default-member-init
  <clang-tidy/checks/cppcoreguidelines/use-default-member-init>` and fixes
  incorrect hints when using list-initialization.

- Improved :doc:`google-build-namespaces
  <clang-tidy/checks/google/build-namespaces>` check by replacing the local
  option `HeaderFileExtensions` by the global option of the same name.

- Improved :doc:`google-global-names-in-headers
  <clang-tidy/checks/google/global-names-in-headers>` check by replacing the local
  option `HeaderFileExtensions` by the global option of the same name.

- Improved :doc:`llvm-header-guard
  <clang-tidy/checks/llvm/header-guard>` check by replacing the local
  option `HeaderFileExtensions` by the global option of the same name.

- Improved :doc:`misc-definitions-in-headers
  <clang-tidy/checks/misc/definitions-in-headers>` check by replacing the local
  option `HeaderFileExtensions` by the global option of the same name.
  Additionally, the option `UseHeaderFileExtensions` is removed, so that the
  check uses the `HeaderFileExtensions` option unconditionally.

- Improved :doc:`misc-unused-using-decls
  <clang-tidy/checks/misc/unused-using-decls>` check by replacing the local
  option `HeaderFileExtensions` by the global option of the same name.

- Improved :doc:`misc-use-anonymous-namespace
  <clang-tidy/checks/misc/use-anonymous-namespace>` check by replacing the local
  option `HeaderFileExtensions` by the global option of the same name.

- Improved :doc:`modernize-avoid-c-arrays
  <clang-tidy/checks/modernize/avoid-c-arrays>` check by introducing the new
  `AllowStringArrays` option, enabling the exclusion of array types with deduced
  length initialized from string literals.

- Improved :doc:`modernize-loop-convert
  <clang-tidy/checks/modernize/loop-convert>` check by ensuring that fix-its
  don't remove parentheses used in ``sizeof`` calls when they have array index
  accesses as arguments.

- Improved :doc:`modernize-use-override
  <clang-tidy/checks/modernize/use-override>` check to also remove any trailing
  whitespace when deleting the ``virtual`` keyword.

- Improved :doc:`readability-implicit-bool-conversion
  <clang-tidy/checks/readability/implicit-bool-conversion>` check to provide
  valid fix suggestions for ``static_cast`` without a preceding space and
  fixed problem with duplicate parentheses in double implicit casts.

- Improved :doc:`readability-redundant-inline-specifier
  <clang-tidy/checks/readability/redundant-inline-specifier>` check to properly
  emit warnings for static data member with an in-class initializer.

- Improved :doc:`readability-identifier-naming
  <clang-tidy/checks/readability/identifier-naming>` check in `GetConfigPerFile`
  mode by resolving symbolic links to header files.

Removed checks
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Removed `cert-dcl21-cpp`, which was deprecated since :program:`clang-tidy` 17,
  since the rule DCL21-CPP has been removed from the CERT guidelines.

Miscellaneous
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Fixed incorrect formatting in ``clang-apply-replacements`` when no ``--format``
  option is specified. Now ``clang-apply-replacements`` applies formatting only with
  the option.
