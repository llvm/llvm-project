Improvements to clang-tidy
--------------------------

- Checks that allow configuring names of headers to include now support wrapping
  the include in angle brackets to create a system include. For example,
  :doc:`cppcoreguidelines-init-variables
  <clang-tidy/checks/cppcoreguidelines-init-variables>` and
  :doc:`modernize-make-unique <clang-tidy/checks/modernize-make-unique>`.

New modules
^^^^^^^^^^^

- New ``altera`` module.

  Includes checks related to OpenCL for FPGA coding guidelines, based on the
  `Altera SDK for OpenCL: Best Practices Guide
  <https://www.altera.com/en_US/pdfs/literature/hb/opencl-sdk/aocl_optimization_guide.pdf>`_.

New checks
^^^^^^^^^^

- New :doc:`altera-struct-pack-align
  <clang-tidy/checks/altera-struct-pack-align>` check.

  Finds structs that are inefficiently packed or aligned, and recommends
  packing and/or aligning of said structs as needed.

- New :doc:`cppcoreguidelines-prefer-member-initializer
  <clang-tidy/checks/cppcoreguidelines-prefer-member-initializer>` check.

  Finds member initializations in the constructor body which can be placed into
  the initialization list instead.

- New :doc:`bugprone-misplaced-pointer-arithmetic-in-alloc
  <clang-tidy/checks/bugprone-misplaced-pointer-arithmetic-in-alloc>` check.

- New :doc:`bugprone-redundant-branch-condition
  <clang-tidy/checks/bugprone-redundant-branch-condition>` check.

  Finds condition variables in nested ``if`` statements that were also checked
  in the outer ``if`` statement and were not changed.

- New :doc:`bugprone-signal-handler
  <clang-tidy/checks/bugprone-signal-handler>` check.

  Finds functions registered as signal handlers that call non asynchronous-safe
  functions.

- New :doc:`cert-sig30-c
  <clang-tidy/checks/cert-sig30-c>` check.

  Alias to the :doc:`bugprone-signal-handler
  <clang-tidy/checks/bugprone-signal-handler>` check.

- New :doc:`readability-function-cognitive-complexity
  <clang-tidy/checks/readability-function-cognitive-complexity>` check.

  Flags functions with Cognitive Complexity metric exceeding the configured limit.

Changes in existing checks
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Improved :doc:`modernize-loop-convert
  <clang-tidy/checks/modernize-loop-convert>` check.

  Now able to transform iterator loops using ``rbegin`` and ``rend`` methods.

- Improved :doc:`readability-identifier-naming
  <clang-tidy/checks/readability-identifier-naming>` check.

  Added an option `GetConfigPerFile` to support including files which use
  different naming styles.

  Now renames overridden virtual methods if the method they override has a
  style violation.
  
  Added support for specifying the style of scoped ``enum`` constants. If 
  unspecified, will fall back to the style for regular ``enum`` constants.

- Removed `google-runtime-references` check because the rule it checks does
  not exist in the Google Style Guide anymore.
