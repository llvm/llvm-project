What's New in Extra Clang Tools |release|?
==========================================

Some of the major new features and improvements to Extra Clang Tools are listed
here. Generic improvements to Extra Clang Tools as a whole or to its underlying
infrastructure are described first, followed by tool-specific sections.

Major New Features
------------------

- The ``clang-pseudo`` tool is incomplete and does not have active maintainers,
  so it has been removed. See
  `the RFC <https://discourse.llvm.org/t/removing-pseudo-parser/71131/>`_ for
  more details.

Improvements to clang-tidy
--------------------------

- Improved :program:`run-clang-tidy.py` script. Fixed minor shutdown noise
  happening on certain platforms when interrupting the script.

New checks
^^^^^^^^^^

New check aliases
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- New alias :doc:`cert-arr39-c <clang-tidy/checks/cert/arr39-c>` to
  :doc:`bugprone-sizeof-expression
  <clang-tidy/checks/bugprone/sizeof-expression>` was added.

Changes in existing checks
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Improved :doc:`bugprone-casting-through-void
  <clang-tidy/checks/bugprone/casting-through-void>` check to suggest replacing
  the offending code with ``reinterpret_cast``, to more clearly express intent.

- Improved :doc:`bugprone-forwarding-reference-overload
  <clang-tidy/checks/bugprone/forwarding-reference-overload>` check by fixing
  a crash when determining if an ``enable_if[_t]`` was found.

- Improved :doc:`bugprone-sizeof-expression
  <clang-tidy/checks/bugprone/sizeof-expression>` check to find suspicious
  usages of ``sizeof()``, ``alignof()``, and ``offsetof()`` when adding or
  subtracting from a pointer.

- Improved :doc:`cert-flp30-c <clang-tidy/checks/cert/flp30-c>` check to
  fix false positive that floating point variable is only used in increment
  expression.

- Improved :doc:`cppcoreguidelines-prefer-member-initializer
  <clang-tidy/checks/cppcoreguidelines/prefer-member-initializer>` check to
  avoid false positive when member initialization depends on a structured
  binding variable.

- Improved :doc:`misc-definitions-in-headers
  <clang-tidy/checks/misc/definitions-in-headers>` check by rewording the
  diagnostic note that suggests adding ``inline``.

- Improved :doc:`modernize-avoid-c-arrays
  <clang-tidy/checks/modernize/avoid-c-arrays>` check to suggest using ``std::span``
  as a replacement for parameters of incomplete C array type in C++20 and 
  ``std::array`` or ``std::vector`` before C++20.

- Improved :doc:`modernize-use-std-format
  <clang-tidy/checks/modernize/use-std-format>` check to support replacing
  member function calls too.

- Improved :doc:`misc-unconventional-assign-operator
  <clang-tidy/checks/misc/unconventional-assign-operator>` check to avoid
  false positive for C++23 deducing this.

- Improved :doc:`modernize-min-max-use-initializer-list
  <clang-tidy/checks/modernize/min-max-use-initializer-list>` check by fixing
  a false positive when only an implicit conversion happened inside an
  initializer list.

- Improved :doc:`modernize-use-std-print
  <clang-tidy/checks/modernize/use-std-print>` check to support replacing
  member function calls too.

- Improved :doc:`readability-enum-initial-value
  <clang-tidy/checks/readability/enum-initial-value>` check by only issuing
  diagnostics for the definition of an ``enum``, and by fixing a typo in the
  diagnostic.

- Improved :doc:`performance-avoid-endl
  <clang-tidy/checks/performance/avoid-endl>` check to use ``std::endl`` as
  placeholder when lexer cannot get source text.

- Improved :doc:`readability-container-contains
  <clang-tidy/checks/readability/container-contains>` check to let it work on
  any class that has a ``contains`` method.

- Improved :doc:`readability-implicit-bool-conversion
  <clang-tidy/checks/readability/implicit-bool-conversion>` check
  by adding the option `UseUpperCaseLiteralSuffix` to select the
  case of the literal suffix in fixes.

- Improved :doc:`readability-redundant-smartptr-get
  <clang-tidy/checks/readability/redundant-smartptr-get>` check to
  remove `->`, when redundant `get()` is removed.
