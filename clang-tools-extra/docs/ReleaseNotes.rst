  Finds calls to ``value_or`` (and alternative spellings ``valueOr``,
  ``ValueOr``) on optional types where the return type is expensive to copy.

Changes in existing checks
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Improved :doc:`readability-named-parameter

  standard tag types (e.g. ``std::in_place_t``, ``std::allocator_arg_t``,
  ``std::nothrow_t``, iterator tags, lock tags, etc.) that are used
  exclusively for overload resolution. Added the :option:`IgnoredTypes`
