What's New in Extra Clang Tools |release|?
==========================================

Some of the major new features and improvements to Extra Clang Tools are listed
here. Generic improvements to Extra Clang Tools as a whole or to its underlying
infrastructure are described first, followed by tool-specific sections.

Major New Features
------------------

...

Improvements to clangd
----------------------

Inlay hints
^^^^^^^^^^^

Diagnostics
^^^^^^^^^^^

Semantic Highlighting
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Compile flags
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Hover
^^^^^

Code completion
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Code actions
^^^^^^^^^^^^

- The tweak for turning unscoped into scoped enums now removes redundant prefixes
  from the enum values.

Signature help
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Cross-references
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Objective-C
^^^^^^^^^^^

Miscellaneous
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Added a boolean option `AnalyzeAngledIncludes` to `Includes` config section,
  which allows to enable unused includes detection for all angled ("system") headers.
  At this moment umbrella headers are not supported, so enabling this option
  may result in false-positives.

Improvements to clang-doc
-------------------------

Improvements to clang-query
---------------------------

- Added the `file` command to dynamically load a list of commands and matchers
  from an external file, allowing the cost of reading the compilation database
  and building the AST to be imposed just once for faster prototyping.

- Removed support for ``enable output srcloc``. Fixes #GH82591

Improvements to clang-rename
----------------------------

The improvements are...

Improvements to clang-tidy
--------------------------

- Improved :program:`run-clang-tidy.py` script. Added argument `-source-filter`
  to filter source files from the compilation database, via a RegEx. In a
  similar fashion to what `-header-filter` does for header files.

- Improved :program:`check_clang_tidy.py` script. Added argument `-export-fixes`
  to aid in clang-tidy and test development.

- Fixed bug where big values for unsigned check options overflowed into negative values
  when being printed with `--dump-config`.

- Fixed `--verify-config` option not properly parsing checks when using the
  literal operator in the `.clang-tidy` config.

- Added argument `--exclude-header-filter` and config option `ExcludeHeaderFilterRegex`
  to exclude headers from analysis via a RegEx.

- Added argument `--allow-no-checks` to suppress "no checks enabled" error
  when disabling all of the checks by `--checks='-*'`.

New checks
^^^^^^^^^^

- New :doc:`bugprone-crtp-constructor-accessibility
  <clang-tidy/checks/bugprone/crtp-constructor-accessibility>` check.

  Detects error-prone Curiously Recurring Template Pattern usage, when the CRTP
  can be constructed outside itself and the derived class.

- New :doc:`bugprone-return-const-ref-from-parameter
  <clang-tidy/checks/bugprone/return-const-ref-from-parameter>` check.

  Detects return statements that return a constant reference parameter as constant
  reference. This may cause use-after-free errors if the caller uses xvalues as
  arguments.

- New :doc:`bugprone-suspicious-stringview-data-usage
  <clang-tidy/checks/bugprone/suspicious-stringview-data-usage>` check.

  Identifies suspicious usages of ``std::string_view::data()`` that could lead
  to reading out-of-bounds data due to inadequate or incorrect string null
  termination.

- New :doc:`misc-use-internal-linkage
  <clang-tidy/checks/misc/use-internal-linkage>` check.

  Detects variables and functions that can be marked as static or moved into
  an anonymous namespace to enforce internal linkage.

- New :doc:`modernize-min-max-use-initializer-list
  <clang-tidy/checks/modernize/min-max-use-initializer-list>` check.

  Replaces nested ``std::min`` and ``std::max`` calls with an initializer list
  where applicable.

- New :doc:`modernize-use-designated-initializers
  <clang-tidy/checks/modernize/use-designated-initializers>` check.

  Finds initializer lists for aggregate types that could be
  written as designated initializers instead.

- New :doc:`modernize-use-std-format
  <clang-tidy/checks/modernize/use-std-format>` check.

  Converts calls to ``absl::StrFormat``, or other functions via
  configuration options, to C++20's ``std::format``, or another function
  via a configuration option, modifying the format string appropriately and
  removing now-unnecessary calls to ``std::string::c_str()`` and
  ``std::string::data()``.

- New :doc:`readability-enum-initial-value
  <clang-tidy/checks/readability/enum-initial-value>` check.

  Enforces consistent style for enumerators' initialization, covering three
  styles: none, first only, or all initialized explicitly.

- New :doc:`readability-math-missing-parentheses
  <clang-tidy/checks/readability/math-missing-parentheses>` check.

  Check for missing parentheses in mathematical expressions that involve
  operators of different priorities.

- New :doc:`readability-use-std-min-max
  <clang-tidy/checks/readability/use-std-min-max>` check.

  Replaces certain conditional statements with equivalent calls to
  ``std::min`` or ``std::max``.

New check aliases
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- New alias :doc:`cert-int09-c <clang-tidy/checks/cert/int09-c>` to
  :doc:`readability-enum-initial-value <clang-tidy/checks/readability/enum-initial-value>`
  was added.

Changes in existing checks
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Improved :doc:`bugprone-assert-side-effect
  <clang-tidy/checks/bugprone/assert-side-effect>` check by detecting side
  effect from calling a method with non-const reference parameters.

- Improved :doc:`bugprone-casting-through-void
  <clang-tidy/checks/bugprone/casting-through-void>` check by ignoring casts
  where source is already a ``void``` pointer, making middle ``void`` pointer
  casts bug-free.

- Improved :doc:`bugprone-forwarding-reference-overload
  <clang-tidy/checks/bugprone/forwarding-reference-overload>`
  check to ignore deleted constructors which won't hide other overloads.

- Improved :doc:`bugprone-inc-dec-in-conditions
  <clang-tidy/checks/bugprone/inc-dec-in-conditions>` check to ignore code
  within unevaluated contexts, such as ``decltype``.

- Improved :doc:`bugprone-lambda-function-name<clang-tidy/checks/bugprone/lambda-function-name>`
  check by ignoring ``__func__`` macro in lambda captures, initializers of
  default parameters and nested function declarations.

- Improved :doc:`bugprone-multi-level-implicit-pointer-conversion
  <clang-tidy/checks/bugprone/multi-level-implicit-pointer-conversion>` check
  by ignoring implicit pointer conversions that are part of a cast expression.

- Improved :doc:`bugprone-non-zero-enum-to-bool-conversion
  <clang-tidy/checks/bugprone/non-zero-enum-to-bool-conversion>` check by
  eliminating false positives resulting from direct usage of bitwise operators
  within parentheses.

- Improved :doc:`bugprone-optional-value-conversion
  <clang-tidy/checks/bugprone/optional-value-conversion>` check by eliminating
  false positives resulting from use of optionals in unevaluated context.

- Improved :doc:`bugprone-sizeof-expression
  <clang-tidy/checks/bugprone/sizeof-expression>` check by eliminating some
  false positives and adding a new (off-by-default) option
  `WarnOnSizeOfPointer` that reports all ``sizeof(pointer)`` expressions
  (except for a few that are idiomatic).

- Improved :doc:`bugprone-suspicious-include
  <clang-tidy/checks/bugprone/suspicious-include>` check by replacing the local
  options `HeaderFileExtensions` and `ImplementationFileExtensions` by the
  global options of the same name.

- Improved :doc:`bugprone-too-small-loop-variable
  <clang-tidy/checks/bugprone/too-small-loop-variable>` check by incorporating
  better support for ``const`` loop boundaries.

- Improved :doc:`bugprone-unused-local-non-trivial-variable

  ignoring local variable with ``[maybe_unused]`` attribute.

- Improved :doc:`bugprone-unused-return-value
  <clang-tidy/checks/bugprone/unused-return-value>` check by updating the
  parameter `CheckedFunctions` to support regexp, avoiding false positive for
  function with the same prefix as the default argument, e.g. ``std::unique_ptr``
  and ``std::unique``, avoiding false positive for assignment operator overloading.

- Improved :doc:`bugprone-use-after-move
  <clang-tidy/checks/bugprone/use-after-move>` check to also handle
  calls to ``std::forward``.

- Improved :doc:`cppcoreguidelines-avoid-non-const-global-variables
  <clang-tidy/checks/cppcoreguidelines/avoid-non-const-global-variables>` check
  with a new option `AllowInternalLinkage` to disable the warning for variables
  with internal linkage.

  <clang-tidy/checks/cppcoreguidelines/macro-usage>` check by ignoring macro with
  hash preprocessing token.

- Improved :doc:`cppcoreguidelines-missing-std-forward
  <clang-tidy/checks/cppcoreguidelines/missing-std-forward>` check by no longer
  giving false positives for deleted functions, by fixing false negatives when only
  a few parameters are forwarded and by ignoring parameters without a name (unused
  arguments).

- Improved :doc:`cppcoreguidelines-owning-memory
  <clang-tidy/checks/cppcoreguidelines/owning-memory>` check to properly handle
  return type in lambdas and in nested functions.

- Improved :doc:`cppcoreguidelines-prefer-member-initializer

  by removing enforcement of rule `C.48
  <https://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines#c48-prefer-in-class-initializers-to-member-initializers-in-constructors-for-constant-initializers>`_,
  which was deprecated since :program:`clang-tidy` 17. This rule is now covered
  by :doc:`cppcoreguidelines-use-default-member-init
  <clang-tidy/checks/cppcoreguidelines/use-default-member-init>`. Fixed
  incorrect hints when using list-initialization.

- Improved :doc:`cppcoreguidelines-special-member-functions
  <clang-tidy/checks/cppcoreguidelines/special-member-functions>` check with a
  new option `AllowImplicitlyDeletedCopyOrMove`, which removes the requirement
  for explicit copy or move special member functions when they are already
  implicitly deleted.

- Improved :doc:`google-build-namespaces
  <clang-tidy/checks/google/build-namespaces>` check by replacing the local
  option `HeaderFileExtensions` by the global option of the same name.

- Improved :doc:`google-explicit-constructor
  <clang-tidy/checks/google/explicit-constructor>` check to better handle

  check by ignoring other functions with same prefixes as the target specific
  functions.

- Improved :doc:`linuxkernel-must-check-errs
  <clang-tidy/checks/linuxkernel/must-check-errs>` check documentation to
  consistently use the check's proper name.

- Improved :doc:`llvm-header-guard
  <clang-tidy/checks/llvm/header-guard>` check by replacing the local
  option `HeaderFileExtensions` by the global option of the same name.

- Improved :doc:`misc-const-correctness
  <clang-tidy/checks/misc/const-correctness>` check by avoiding infinite recursion
  for recursive functions with forwarding reference parameters and reference
  variables which refer to themselves.

- Improved :doc:`misc-definitions-in-headers
  <clang-tidy/checks/misc/definitions-in-headers>` check by replacing the local
  option `HeaderFileExtensions` by the global option of the same name.
  Additionally, the option `UseHeaderFileExtensions` is removed, so that the
  check uses the `HeaderFileExtensions` option unconditionally.

- Improved :doc:`misc-header-include-cycle
  <clang-tidy/checks/misc/header-include-cycle>` check by avoiding crash for self
  include cycles.

- Improved :doc:`misc-unused-using-decls
  <clang-tidy/checks/misc/unused-using-decls>` check by replacing the local

- Improved :doc:`modernize-avoid-c-arrays
  <clang-tidy/checks/modernize/avoid-c-arrays>` check by introducing the new
  `AllowStringArrays` option, enabling the exclusion of array types with deduced
  length initialized from string literals.

- Improved :doc:`modernize-loop-convert
  <clang-tidy/checks/modernize/loop-convert>` check by ensuring that fix-its
  don't remove parentheses used in ``sizeof`` calls when they have array index
  accesses as arguments.

- Improved :doc:`modernize-use-constraints
  <clang-tidy/checks/modernize/use-constraints>` check by fixing a crash that
  occurred in some scenarios and excluding system headers from analysis.

- Improved :doc:`modernize-use-nullptr
  <clang-tidy/checks/modernize/use-nullptr>` check to include support for C23,
  which also has introduced the ``nullptr`` keyword.

- Improved :doc:`modernize-use-override
  <clang-tidy/checks/modernize/use-override>` check to also remove any trailing
  whitespace when deleting the ``virtual`` keyword.

- Improved :doc:`modernize-use-starts-ends-with
  <clang-tidy/checks/modernize/use-starts-ends-with>` check to also handle
  calls to ``compare`` method.

- Improved :doc:`modernize-use-std-print
  <clang-tidy/checks/modernize/use-std-print>` check to not crash if the
  format string parameter of the function to be replaced is not of the
  expected type.

- Improved :doc:`modernize-use-using <clang-tidy/checks/modernize/use-using>`
  check by adding support for detection of typedefs declared on function level.

- Improved :doc:`performance-inefficient-vector-operation
  <clang-tidy/checks/performance/inefficient-vector-operation>` fixing false
  negatives caused by different variable definition type and variable initial
  value type in loop initialization expression.

- Improved :doc:`performance-move-const-arg
  <clang-tidy/checks/performance/move-const-arg>` check by ignoring
  ``std::move()`` calls when their target is used as an rvalue.

- Improved :doc:`performance-unnecessary-copy-initialization
  <clang-tidy/checks/performance/unnecessary-copy-initialization>` check by
  detecting more cases of constant access. In particular, pointers can be
  analyzed, so the check now handles the common patterns
  `const auto e = (*vector_ptr)[i]` and `const auto e = vector_ptr->at(i);`.
  Calls to mutable function where there exists a `const` overload are also
  handled. Fix crash in the case of a non-member operator call.

- Improved :doc:`readability-avoid-return-with-void-value
  <clang-tidy/checks/readability/avoid-return-with-void-value>` check by adding
  fix-its.

- Improved :doc:`readability-const-return-type
  <clang-tidy/checks/readability/const-return-type>` check to eliminate false
  positives when returning types with const not at the top level.

- Improved :doc:`readability-container-size-empty
  <clang-tidy/checks/readability/container-size-empty>` check to prevent false
  positives when utilizing ``size`` or ``length`` methods that accept parameter.
  Fixed crash when facing template user defined literals.

- Improved :doc:`readability-duplicate-include
  <clang-tidy/checks/readability/duplicate-include>` check by excluding include
  directives that form the filename using macro.

- Improved :doc:`readability-else-after-return
  <clang-tidy/checks/readability/else-after-return>` check to ignore
  `if consteval` statements, for which the `else` branch must not be removed.

- Improved :doc:`readability-identifier-naming
  <clang-tidy/checks/readability/identifier-naming>` check in `GetConfigPerFile`
  mode by resolving symbolic links to header files. Fixed handling of Hungarian
  Prefix when configured to `LowerCase`. Added support for renaming designated
  initializers. Added support for renaming macro arguments. Fixed renaming
  conflicts arising from out-of-line member function template definitions.

- Improved :doc:`readability-implicit-bool-conversion
  <clang-tidy/checks/readability/implicit-bool-conversion>` check to provide
  valid fix suggestions for ``static_cast`` without a preceding space and
  fixed problem with duplicate parentheses in double implicit casts. Corrected
  the fix suggestions for C23 and later by using C-style casts instead of
  ``static_cast``. Fixed false positives in C++20 spaceship operator by ignoring
  casts in implicit and defaulted functions.

- Improved :doc:`readability-redundant-inline-specifier
  <clang-tidy/checks/readability/redundant-inline-specifier>` check to properly
  emit warnings for static data member with an in-class initializer.

- Improved :doc:`readability-redundant-member-init
  <clang-tidy/checks/readability/redundant-member-init>` check to avoid
  false-positives when type of the member does not match the type of the
  initializer.

- Improved :doc:`readability-static-accessed-through-instance
  <clang-tidy/checks/readability/static-accessed-through-instance>` check to
  support calls to overloaded operators as base expression and provide fixes to
  expressions with side-effects.

- Improved :doc:`readability-simplify-boolean-expr
  <clang-tidy/checks/readability/simplify-boolean-expr>` check to avoid to emit
  warning for macro when IgnoreMacro option is enabled and improve messages
  when auto-fix does not work.

- Improved :doc:`readability-static-definition-in-anonymous-namespace
  <clang-tidy/checks/readability/static-definition-in-anonymous-namespace>`
  check by resolving fix-it overlaps in template code by disregarding implicit
  instances.

- Improved :doc:`readability-string-compare
  <clang-tidy/checks/readability/string-compare>` check to also detect
  usages of ``std::string_view::compare``. Added a `StringLikeClasses` option
  to detect usages of ``compare`` method in custom string-like classes.

Removed checks
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Removed `cert-dcl21-cpp`, which was deprecated since :program:`clang-tidy` 17,
  since the rule DCL21-CPP has been removed from the CERT guidelines.

Miscellaneous
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Fixed incorrect formatting in :program:`clang-apply-replacements` when no
  `--format` option is specified. Now :program:`clang-apply-replacements`
  applies formatting only with the option.
