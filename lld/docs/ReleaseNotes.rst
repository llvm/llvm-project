Non-comprehensive list of changes in this release
=================================================

ELF Improvements
----------------

* When ``--threads=`` is not specified, the number of concurrency is now capped to 16.
  A large ``--thread=`` can harm performance, especially with some system
  malloc implementations like glibc's.
  (`D147493 <https://reviews.llvm.org/D147493>`_)
* ``--remap-inputs=`` and ``--remap-inputs-file=`` are added to remap input files.
  (`D148859 <https://reviews.llvm.org/D148859>`_)
* ``--lto=`` is now available to support ``clang -funified-lto``
  (`D123805 <https://reviews.llvm.org/D123805>`_)
* ``--lto-CGO[0-3]`` is now available to control ``CodeGenOpt::Level`` independent of the LTO optimization level.
  (`D141970 <https://reviews.llvm.org/D141970>`_)
* ``--check-dynamic-relocations=`` is now correct 32-bit targets when the addend is larger than 0x80000000.
  (`D149347 <https://reviews.llvm.org/D149347>`_)
* ``--print-memory-usage`` has been implemented for memory regions.
  (`D150644 <https://reviews.llvm.org/D150644>`_)
* ``SHF_MERGE``, ``--icf=``, and ``--build-id=fast`` have switched to 64-bit xxh3.
  (`D154813 <https://reviews.llvm.org/D154813>`_)
* Quoted output section names can now be used in linker scripts.
  (`#60496 <https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues/60496>`_)
* ``MEMORY`` can now be used without a ``SECTIONS`` command.
  (`D145132 <https://reviews.llvm.org/D145132>`_)
* ``REVERSE`` can now be used in input section descriptions to reverse the order of input sections.
  (`D145381 <https://reviews.llvm.org/D145381>`_)
* Program header assignment can now be used within ``OVERLAY``. This functionality was accidentally lost in 2020.
  (`D150445 <https://reviews.llvm.org/D150445>`_)
* Operators ``^`` and ``^=`` can now be used in linker scripts.
* LoongArch is now supported.
* ``DT_AARCH64_MEMTAG_*`` dynamic tags are now supported.
  (`D143769 <https://reviews.llvm.org/D143769>`_)
* AArch32 port now supports BE-8 and BE-32 modes for big-endian.
  (`D140201 <https://reviews.llvm.org/D140201>`_)
  (`D140202 <https://reviews.llvm.org/D140202>`_)
  (`D150870 <https://reviews.llvm.org/D150870>`_)
* ``R_ARM_THM_ALU_ABS_G*`` relocations are now supported.
  (`D153407 <https://reviews.llvm.org/D153407>`_)
* ``.ARM.exidx`` sections may start at non-zero output section offset.
  (`D148033 <https://reviews.llvm.org/D148033>`_)
* Arm Cortex-M Security Extensions is now implemented.
  (`D139092 <https://reviews.llvm.org/D139092>`_)
* BTI landing pads are now added to PLT entries accessed by range extension thunks or relative vtables.
  (`D148704 <https://reviews.llvm.org/D148704>`_)
  (`D153264 <https://reviews.llvm.org/D153264>`_)
* AArch64 short range thunk has been implemented to mitigate the performance loss of a long range thunk.
  (`D148701 <https://reviews.llvm.org/D148701>`_)
* ``R_AVR_8_LO8/R_AVR_8_HI8/R_AVR_8_HLO8/R_AVR_LO8_LDI_GS/R_AVR_HI8_LDI_GS`` have been implemented.
  (`D147100 <https://reviews.llvm.org/D147100>`_)
  (`D147364 <https://reviews.llvm.org/D147364>`_)
* ``--no-power10-stubs`` now works for PowerPC64.
* ``DT_PPC64_OPT`` is now supported;
  (`D150631 <https://reviews.llvm.org/D150631>`_)
* ``PT_RISCV_ATTRIBUTES`` is added to include the SHT_RISCV_ATTRIBUTES section.
  (`D152065 <https://reviews.llvm.org/D152065>`_)
* ``R_RISCV_PLT32`` is added to support C++ relative vtables.
  (`D143115 <https://reviews.llvm.org/D143115>`_)
* RISC-V global pointer relaxation has been implemented. Specify ``--relax-gp`` to enable the linker relaxation.
  (`D143673 <https://reviews.llvm.org/D143673>`_)
* The symbol value of ``foo`` is correctly handled when ``--wrap=foo`` and RISC-V linker relaxation are used.
  (`D151768 <https://reviews.llvm.org/D151768>`_)
* x86-64 large data sections are now placed away from code sections to alleviate relocation overflow pressure.
  (`D150510 <https://reviews.llvm.org/D150510>`_)

Breaking changes
----------------

COFF Improvements
-----------------

* lld-link can now find libraries with relative paths that are relative to
  `/libpath`. Before it would only be able to find libraries relative to the
  current directory.
  I.e. ``lld-link /libpath:c:\relative\root relative\path\my.lib`` where before
  we would have to do ``lld-link /libpath:c:\relative\root\relative\path my.lib``
* lld-link learned -print-search-paths that will print all the paths where it will
  search for libraries.
* By default lld-link will now search for libraries in the toolchain directories.
  Specifically it will search:
  ``<toolchain>/lib``, ``<toolchain>/lib/clang/<version>/lib`` and
  ``<toolchain>/lib/clang/<version>/lib/windows``.

MinGW Improvements
------------------

MachO Improvements
------------------

WebAssembly Improvements
------------------------

Fixes
#####

* Arm exception index tables (.ARM.exidx sections) are now output
  correctly when they are at a non zero offset within their output
  section. (`D148033 <https://reviews.llvm.org/D148033>`_)
