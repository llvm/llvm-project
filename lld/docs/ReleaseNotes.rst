Non-comprehensive list of changes in this release
=================================================

ELF Improvements
----------------

* ``ELFCOMPRESS_ZSTD`` compressed input sections are now supported.
  (`D129406 <https://reviews.llvm.org/D129406>`_)
* ``--compress-debug-sections=zstd`` is now available to compress debug
  sections with zstd (``ELFCOMPRESS_ZSTD``).
  (`D133548 <https://reviews.llvm.org/D133548>`_)
* ``--no-warnings``/``-w`` is now available to suppress warnings.
  (`D136569 <https://reviews.llvm.org/D136569>`_)

Breaking changes
----------------

COFF Improvements
-----------------

* The linker command line entry in ``S_ENVBLOCK`` of the PDB is now stripped
  from input files, to align with MSVC behavior.
  (`D137723 <https://reviews.llvm.org/D137723>`_)
* Switched from SHA1 to BLAKE3 for PDB type hashing / ``-gcodeview-ghash``
  (`D137101 <https://reviews.llvm.org/D137101>`_)

MinGW Improvements
------------------

* The lld-specific options ``--guard-cf``, ``--no-guard-cf``,
  ``--guard-longjmp`` and ``--no-guard-longjmp`` has been added to allow
  enabling Control Flow Guard and long jump hardening. These options are
  disabled by default, but enabling ``--guard-cf`` will also enable
  ``--guard-longjmp`` unless ``--no-guard-longjmp`` is also specified.
  ``--guard-longjmp`` depends on ``--guard-cf`` and cannot be used by itself.
  Note that these features require the ``_load_config_used`` symbol to contain
  the load config directory and be filled with the required symbols.
  (`D132808 <https://reviews.llvm.org/D132808>`_)
