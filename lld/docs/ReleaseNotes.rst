Non-comprehensive list of changes in this release
=================================================

ELF Improvements
----------------

* ``-z nosectionheader`` has been implemented to omit the section header table.
  The operation is similar to ``llvm-objcopy --strip-sections``.
  (`#101286 <https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pull/101286>`_)
* Section ``CLASS`` linker script syntax binds input sections to named classes,
  which are referenced later one or more times. This provides access to the
  automatic spilling mechanism of `--enable-non-contiguous-regions` without
  globally changing the semantics of section matching. It also independently
  increases the expressive power of linker scripts.
  (`#95323 <https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pull/95323>`_)

Breaking changes
----------------

COFF Improvements
-----------------
* ``/includeglob`` has been implemented to match the behavior of ``--undefined-glob`` available for ELF.

MinGW Improvements
------------------
* ``--undefined-glob`` is now supported by translating into the ``/includeglob`` flag.

MachO Improvements
------------------

WebAssembly Improvements
