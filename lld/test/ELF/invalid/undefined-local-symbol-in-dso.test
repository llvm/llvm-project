# REQUIRES: x86

# LLD used to crash when linking against a DSO with an undefined STB_LOCAL
# symbol in the global part of the dynamic symbol table (i.e. an STB_LOCAL
# symbol with an index >= the sh_info of the dynamic symbol table section). Such
# a DSO is very broken, because local symbols should precede all global symbols
# in the symbol table, and because having a symbol that's both undefined and
# STB_LOCAL is a nonsensical combination. Nevertheless, we should error on such
# input files instead of crashing.

# RUN: yaml2obj %s -o %t.so
# RUN: not ld.lld %t.so -o /dev/null 2>&1 | FileCheck %s
# CHECK: error: {{.*}}.so: invalid local symbol 'foo' in global part of symbol table
