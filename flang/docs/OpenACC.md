# OpenACC in Flang

```{contents}

## Intentional deviation from the specification
* The end directive for combined construct can omit the `loop` keyword.
* An `!$acc routine` with no parallelism clause is treated as if the `seq`
  clause was present.
* `!$acc end loop` does not trigger a parsing error and is just ignored.
* The restriction on `!$acc data` required clauses is emitted as a portability
  warning instead of an error as other compiler accepts it.
