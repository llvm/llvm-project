# Flang Fortran Standards Support

```{contents}

local:

```

This document summarizes Fortran standards support in Flang. The information is only provided as a guideline. The
TODOs/Not Yet Implemented messages emitted by the compiler for unimplemented features should be treated as authoritative.

The standards support information is provided as a table with three columns that are self explanatory.
The Status column uses the letters **Y**, **P**, **N** for the implementation status:
- **Y** : Yes. When the implementation is complete
- **P** : Partial. When the implementation is incomplete for a few cases
- **N** : No. When the implementation is absent

There is no distinction made between support in the Parser/Semantics and the MLIR or Lowering stages.

Note: The two major missing features in Flang at present are coarrays and parameterized derived types (PDTs) with length type parameters.


## Fortran 2023
See [document](F202X.md) for a brief discussion about the new features in Fortran 2023. The following table summarizes the
status of all important Fortran 2023 features. The table entries are based on the document [The new features in Fortran 2023](https://wg5-fortran.org/N2201-N2250/N2212.pdf).
