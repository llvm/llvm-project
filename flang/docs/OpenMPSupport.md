# Flang OpenMP Support

```{contents}

```

This document outlines the OpenMP API features supported by Flang. It is intended as a general reference.
For the most accurate information on unimplemented features, rely on the compiler’s TODO or “Not Yet Implemented”
messages, which are considered authoritative.  With the exception of a few corner cases, Flang
offers full support for OpenMP 3.1 ([See details here](#openmp-31-openmp-25-openmp-11)).
Partial support for OpenMP 4.0 is also available and currently under active development.
The table below outlines the current status of OpenMP 4.0 feature support.
Work is ongoing to add support for OpenMP 4.5 and newer versions; a support statement for these will be shared in the future.
The table entries are derived from the information provided in the Version Differences subsection of the Features History section in the OpenMP standard.

The feature support information is provided as a table with three columns that are self explanatory. The Status column uses
the letters **P**, **Y**, **N** for the implementation status:
- **P** : Partial. When the implementation is incomplete for a few cases
- **Y** : Yes. When the implementation is complete
- **N** : No. When the implementation is absent

Note : No distinction is made between the support in Parser/Semantics, MLIR, Lowering or the OpenMPIRBuilder.

## OpenMP 4.0

## OpenMP 3.1, OpenMP 2.5, OpenMP 1.1
All features except a few corner cases in atomic (complex type, different but compatible types in lhs and rhs), threadprivate (character type) constructs/clauses are supported.
