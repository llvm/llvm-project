## Driver

### Why do I get a warning or an error about an executable stack?

This occurs because Flang's implementation of pointers to internal procedures requires an executable stack.

When an internal procedure is referenced from outside its host scope (for example, via a procedure pointer), the implementation must ensure that it can still access variables from that host scope.
To achieve this, the current implementation of Flang generates a small piece of code, called a "trampoline", on the stack.
When the procedure is called, execution first goes through this trampoline.
This means that the stack must be executable.
For a more detailed explanation of trampolines, please refer to the [design document](InternalProcedureTrampolines.md).

However, an executable stack can introduce security vulnerabilities (for example, by increasing the impact of [stack buffer overflow attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffer_overflow#Stack-based_exploitation)).
Therefore, modern linkers often issue a warning or an error if an executable stack is not explicitly requested by the developer.
For instance, the GNU Linker (`ld`) issues a warning while the LLVM Linker (`lld`) emits an error.

```{note}
The trampoline code generated by Flang is not itself a security risk.
The risk comes from the possibility of executing malicious code, that is injected into the program, from the stack.
```

When you use the Flang driver (the `flang` command) to generate executables, you can instruct the linker to enable an executable stack with the `-Wl,-z,execstack` or `-Xlinker -zexecstack` flag.

```console
$ flang src.f90 -fuse-ld=ld
/path/to/ld: warning: src.o: requires executable stack (because the .note.GNU-stack section is executable)
$ flang src.f90 -fuse-ld=ld -Wl,-z,execstack

$ flang src.f90 -fuse-ld=lld
ld.lld: error: src.o: requires an executable stack, but -z execstack is not specified
flang-22: error: linker command failed with exit code 1 (use -v to see invocation)
$ flang src.f90 -fuse-ld=lld -Wl,-z,execstack
```
