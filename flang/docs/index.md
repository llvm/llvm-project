# Welcome to Flang's documentation

Flang is LLVM's Fortran frontend that can be found
[here](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/tree/main/flang). It is often
referred to as "LLVM Flang" to differentiate itself from ["Classic
Flang"](https://github.com/flang-compiler/flang) - these are two separate and
independent Fortran compilers. LLVM Flang is under active development. While it
is capable of generating executables for a number of examples, some
functionality is still missing. See [Getting Involved](GettingInvolved) for tips
on how to get in touch with us and to learn more about the current status.
