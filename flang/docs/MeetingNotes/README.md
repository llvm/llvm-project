# Combined Flang Community Call Notes

## About these notes

This directory combines the notes from the LLVM Flang Technical Calls
and the LLVM Flang Community Calls. This was done to make the Community Call 
notes more easily available than before.

## Helpful definitions

-   "LLVM Flang" is the Fortran 2018 compiler being developed as part of the 
LLVM project, and located in the LLVM monorepo ([github.com/llvm/llvm-project](http://github.com/llvm/llvm-project)).  
-   "Classic Flang" is the Fortran 2003/2008 compiler located at [github.com/flang-compiler/flang](http://github.com/flang-compiler/flang).

## Call Information
- Details about the call can be found in [GettingInvolved.md](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/main/flang/docs/GettingInvolved.md) under the heading "Flang Biweekly Call"

## Flang Community

* **Websites:**  
  * **LLVM Flang:** [https://flang.llvm.org](https://flang.llvm.org)   
  * **Classic Flang:** [https://github.com/flang-compiler/flang](https://github.com/flang-compiler/flang) 

* **Issues:**  
  * Issues for LLVM Flang should be reported in GitHub: [https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues).
  Use the "flang" tag for flang-related issues, please  
  * Issues for Classic Flang should be reported to the GitHub issues section at either [https://github.com/flang-compiler/flang/issues](https://github.com/flang-compiler/flang/issues)
  or [flang-compiler/flang-driver](https://github.com/flang-compiler/flang-driver) as appropriate

* **LLVM mailing lists and Discourse channels:** There are now two communication channels hosted by llvm.org:  
  * The Flang Discourse channel: [https://discourse.llvm.org/c/subprojects/flang/33](https://discourse.llvm.org/c/subprojects/flang/33)   
  * The flang-commits mailing list: subscribe at [https://lists.llvm.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/flang-commits](https://lists.llvm.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/flang-commits) 

* **Slack:** The [flang-compiler.slack.com](http://flang-compiler.slack.com)
workspace is used for informal real-time communication in the Flang community.  
  * Classic Flang \- use the Slack channel \#classic-flang-pull-requests to
 coordinate what pull requests you are working on

* **LLVM Flang Development:**  
  * On GitHub: The source code for LLVM Flang is available on [https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/tree/main/flang](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/tree/main/flang). It is recommended to start in the "docs" directory.  
  * Public plan: The team maintains a plan for upcoming Flang work at [https://github.com/orgs/flang-compiler/projects/](https://github.com/orgs/flang-compiler/projects/). This reflects current LLVM Flang priorities and context for the
  project and its long-term goals. (OpenMP work for flang, clang, and
  OpenMPIRBuilder is tracked separately.)

* **Classic Flang Development:**  
  * Outstanding pull requests: [https://github.com/flang-compiler/flang/pulls](https://github.com/flang-compiler/flang/pulls)
  for the current list of 
pull requests  
  * Current status of Fortran 2008 features can be found at [https://github.com/flang-compiler/flang/wiki/Fortran-2008](https://github.com/flang-compiler/flang/wiki/Fortran-2008).
