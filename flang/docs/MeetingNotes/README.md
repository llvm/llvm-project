# Combined Flang Community Call Notes

## About these notes

This directory combines the notes from the Flang Technical and Community Calls. This was done to make the call notes more easily available than before. All references to Flang in these documents refer to the Fortran compiler being developed as part of the LLVM project and located in the LLVM monorepo ([github.com/llvm/llvm-project](http://github.com/llvm/llvm-project)). Information about "Classic Flang", a separate and independent Fortran compiler, can be found at [github.com/flang-compiler/flang](http://github.com/flang-compiler/flang).

## Call Information
- Details about the call can be found in the [Getting Involved](https://flang.llvm.org/docs/GettingInvolved.html#flang-biweekly-call) page in flang's documentation.
