# Combined Call 2025-12-17

## Agenda

* No meeting on 12/31
* Update on meeting notes document
  * What will protect the data if something should happen to Discourse?
  * RFC is a good idea
* Design docs and/or RFCs
  * [Changes to builtin modules](https://discourse.llvm.org/t/changes-to-builtin-modules/89072)
    * PR was reverted due to buildbot failure involving Windows
    * Undergoing another review process, will not try landing again until after the first of the year
  * [\[RFC\] Proposing an Interactive Fortran Workflow with Flang using Jupyter Notebooks](https://discourse.llvm.org/t/rfc-proposing-an-interactive-fortran-workflow-with-flang-using-jupyter-notebooks/89116/5)
    * Intention is to build a flang-repl in the context of Jupyter Notebooks
    * Seems unclear what the authors expect from the greater Flang community
    * Looking for assistance with making changes to flang to make the repl work and/or for info about what barriers exist to creating it in the first place (possibly also looking for funding)
    * Unsure why they are choosing to use Flang instead of continue the LFortran work
      * Possibly to do with level of standards compliance
  * [\[RFC\] Support \-fstrict-aliasing and \-fno-strict-aliasing](https://discourse.llvm.org/t/rfc-support-fstrict-aliasing-and-fno-strict-aliasing/89135)
    * Related to an issue that came in, these flags are supported in both gcc and clang
    * Would affect type-based alias analysis
    * Does this have any implications for Fortran code specifically? Does it violate the standard?
    * Michael Klemm can ask some gfortran developers directly
    * Related issue: [https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues/171912](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues/171912)
  * [\`-ffp-contract=fast\` Violates the Fortran Standard](https://discourse.llvm.org/t/ffp-contract-fast-violates-the-fortran-standard/88897)
    * Still under debate
* PRs of Note
  *  [\[flang\]\[driver\] Do not allow \-module-dir to be joined to the value \#168748](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pull/168748)
    * Currently, although it is a long-form option, the value is joined to it
    * Likely, we will not be able to add options that start with \-module-dir given the current implementation
    * Changing this will affect CMake usage (CMake PR to use the \-J option has been accepted, but not backported to older versions)
    * Potential compatibility problem with gfortran
  * [\[Flang\]\[FIR\] Introduce FIRToCoreMLIR pass. \#168703](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pull/168703)
* Issues of Note
  * [Building Flang with offload support](https://discourse.llvm.org/t/building-flang-with-offload-support/89100)
* FYI
  * LLVM \- [Document the community RFC process](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pull/116386)
  * [2026 EuroLLVM Developers' Meeting \- Call for Proposals](https://discourse.llvm.org/t/2026-eurollvm-developers-meeting-call-for-proposals/89059)
* Other topics as time allows
  * Flang-tidy update next time
  * Fujitsu test suite discussion next time (how to make it easier for people to use)

## Details

* Consists of over **707,000** lines of code, documentation, build files, and test
* To date, over **11,511** commits have been made to Flang
