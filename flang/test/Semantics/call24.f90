! 15.4.2.2. Test that errors are reported when an explicit interface
! is not provided for an external procedure that requires an explicit
! interface (the definition needs to be visible so that the compiler
! can detect the violation).

  ! but its handling with an implicit interface is different (no
  ! descriptor involved, copy-in/copy-out...)

  ! This call would be error if the interface was explicit here.

  !ERROR: References to the procedure 'foo' require an explicit interface

  !ERROR: References to the procedure 'bar' require an explicit interface
  !WARNING: If the procedure's interface were explicit, this reference would be in error
  !BECAUSE: Actual argument associated with procedure pointer dummy argument 'a_pointer=' must be a POINTER unless INTENT(IN)
