# Flang Integration Tests

This directory can be used to add Integration tests involving multiple stages of the compiler (for eg. from Fortran to LLVM IR). It should not contain executable tests. We should only add tests here sparingly and only if there is no other way to test. Repeat this message in each test that is added to this directory and sub-directories.
