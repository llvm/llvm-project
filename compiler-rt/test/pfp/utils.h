// The crash tests would fail to crash (causing the test to fail) if:
// - The operating system did not enable the DA key, or
// - The CPU supports FEAT_PAuth but not FEAT_FPAC.
// Therefore, they call this function, which will crash the test process if one
// of these cases is detected so that %expect_crash detects the crash and causes
// the test to pass.
//
// We detect the former case by attempting to sign a pointer. If the signed
// pointer is equal to the unsigned pointer, DA is likely disabled, so we crash.
//
// We detect the latter case by reading ID_AA64ISAR1_EL1 and ID_AA64ISAR2_EL1.
// It is expected that the operating system will either trap and emulate reading
// the system registers (as Linux does) or crash the process. In the
// trap/emulate case we check the APA, API and APA3 fields for FEAT_FPAC support
// and crash if it is not available. In the crash case we will crash when
// reading the register leading to a passing test. This means that operating
// systems with the crashing behavior do not support the crash tests.
//
// On non-AArch64 platforms, the generic form of PFP is used which will always
// detect the bug, so this function does nothing.
