LOCAL_LABEL(mul):

  // Here we multiply the mantissas, and compute the output exponent by adding
  // the input exponents and rebiasing. These operations are interleaved to
  // use a delay slot.
  //
  // The exponent is rebiased by subtracting 0x80, rather than the 0x7F you'd

  // Compress the double-word product into just the high-order word r3, by
  // setting its bit 0 if any bit of the low-order word is nonzero. This
  // changes the represented value, but not by nearly enough to affect
  // rounding, because rounding only depends on the bit below the last output
  // bit, and the general question of whether _any_ nonzero bit exists below
  // that.

  orrne   r3, r3, #1            //   then set LSB of high word

  // The two inputs to UMULL had their high bits set, that is, were at least
  // 0x80000000. So the 64-bit product was at least 0x4000000000000000, i.e.
  // the high bit of the product could be at the top of the word or one bit
  // below. Check which, by experimentally shifting left, and then undoing it
  // via RRX if we turned out to have shifted off a 1 bit.
  lsls    r3, r3, #1            // shift left, setting C to the bit shifted off
  rrxcs   r3, r3                // if that bit was 1, put it back again

  // That ensured the leading 1 bit of the product is now the top of r3, but
  // also, set C if the leading 1 was _already_ in the top bit. So now we know
  // whether to increment the exponent. The following instruction does the
  // conditional increment (because it's ADC), but also, copies the exponent
  // field from bit 16 of r2 into bit 0, so as to place it just below the
  // output sign bit.
  //
  // So, if the number hasn't overflowed or underflowed, the low 9 bits of r2
  // are exactly what we need to combine with the rounded mantissa. But the
  // full output exponent (with extra bits) is still available in the high half
  // of r2, so that we can check _whether_ we overflowed or underflowed.
  adc     r2, r2, r2, asr #16

  // Recombine the exponent and mantissa, doing most of the rounding as a side
  // effect: we shift the mantissa right so as to put the round bit into C, and

  // if C was set.
  movs    r12, r3, lsr #8

  // To complete the rounding, we must check for the round-to-even tiebreaking
  // case, by checking if we're in the exact halfway case, which occurs if and
  // only if we _did_ round up (we can tell this because C is still set from
  // the MOVS), and also, no bit of r3 is set _below_ the round bit.
  //
  // We combine this with an overflow check, so that C ends up set if anything
  // weird happened, and clear if we're completely finished and can return.
  //
  // The best instruction sequence for this part varies between Arm and Thumb.
#if !__thumb__
  // Arm state: if C was set then we check the low bits of r3, so that Z ends
  // up set if we need to round to even.
  //
  // (We rely here on Z reliably being clear to begin with, because shifting
  // down the output mantissa definitely gave a nonzero output. Also, the TST
  // doesn't change C, so if Z does end up set, then C was also set.)
  //
  // Then, if we're not rounding to even, we do a CMP which sets C if there's
  // been an overflow or an underflow. An overflow could occur for an output
  // exponent as low as 0xFC, because we might increment the exponent by 1 when
  // renormalizing, by another when recombining with the mantissa, and by one
  // more if rounding up causes a carry off the top of the mantissa. An
  // underflow occurs only if the output exponent is negative (because it's
  // offset by 1, so an exponent of 0 will be incremented to 1), in which case
  // the top 8 bits of r2 will all be set. Therefore, an unsigned comparison to
  // see if r2 > 0xFC0000 will catch all overflow and underflow cases. It also
  // catches a few very large cases that _don't_ quite overflow (exponents of
  // 0xFC and above that don't get maximally unlucky); those will also be
  // handled by the slow path.
  tstcs   r3, #0x7F

#else
  // In Thumb, switching between different conditions has a higher cost due to
  // the (implicit in this code) IT instructions, so we prefer a strategy that
  // uses CC and CS conditions throughout, at the cost of requiring some extra
  // cleanup instructions on the slow path.
  //
  // If C is set (and hence round-to-even is a possibility), the basic idea is
  // to shift the full result word (r3) left by 25, leaving only its bottom 7
  // bits, which are now the top 7 bits; then we want to set C iff these are 0.
  //
  // The "CMP x,y" instruction sets C if y > x (as unsigned integers). So this
  // could be done in one instruction if only we had a register to use as x,
  // which has 0 in the top 7 bits and at least one nonzero. Then we could
  // compare that against the shifted-up value of r3, setting C precisely if
  // the top 7 bits of y are greater than 0. And happily, we _do_ have such a
  // register! r12 contains the shifted-down mantissa, which is guaranteed to
  // have a 1 in bit 23, and 0 above that.
  //
  // The shift of r3 happens only in the second operand of the compare, so we
  // don't lose the original value of r3 in this process.
  //
  // The check for over/underflow is exactly as in the Arm branch above, except
  // based on a different condition.
  cmpcs   r12, r3, lsl #25  // now C is set iff we're rounding to even
  cmpcc   r2, #0xFC0000     // and now it's also set if we've over/underflowed

  // That's all the checks for difficult cases done. If C is clear, we can
  // return.
  bxcc    lr

  // Now the slower path begins. We have to recover enough information to
  // handle all of round-to-even, overflow and underflow.
  //
  // Round to even is the most likely of these, so we detect it first and
  // handle it as fast as possible.

#if __thumb__
  // First, Thumb-specific compensation code. The Arm branch of the #if above
  // will have set Z=0 to indicate round to even, but the Thumb branch didn't
  // leave any unambiguous indicator of RTE, so we must retest by checking all
  // the bits shifted off the bottom of the mantissa to see if they're exactly
  // the half-way value.
  lsl     r12, r3, #24           // r12 = round bit and everything below
  cmp     r12, #0x80000000       // set Z if that is exactly 0x80000000
#endif

  // Now Z is clear iff we have already rounded up and now must replace that
  // with rounding to even, which is done by just clearing the low bit of the
  // mantissa.
  biceq   r0, r0, #1

  // Redo the over/underflow check (the same way as in both branches above),
  // and if it doesn't report a danger, we can return the rounded-to-even
  // answer.

  bxcc    lr                    // and return if none.

  // Now we only have overflow and underflow left to handle. First, find out
  // which we're looking at. This is easy by testing the top bit of r2, but
  // even easier by using the fact that the possible positive and negative
  // values of r2 are widely enough separated that the 0xFC0000 subtracted by
  // the CMP above won't have made any difference. So the N flag output from
  // that comparison _already_ tells us which condition we have: if N is set we
  // have underflow, and if N is clear, overflow.
