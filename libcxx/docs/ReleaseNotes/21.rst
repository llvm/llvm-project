   These are in-progress notes for the upcoming libc++ 20.0.0 release.
   Release notes for previous releases can be found on
   `the Download Page <https://releases.llvm.org/download.html>`_.

Introduction
============

This document contains the release notes for the libc++ C++ Standard Library,
part of the LLVM Compiler Infrastructure, release 20.0.0. Here we describe the
status of libc++ in some detail, including major improvements from the previous
release and new feature work. For the general LLVM release notes, see `the LLVM
documentation <https://llvm.org/docs/ReleaseNotes.html>`_. All LLVM releases may
be downloaded from the `LLVM releases web site <https://llvm.org/releases/>`_.

For more information about libc++, please see the `Libc++ Web Site
<https://libcxx.llvm.org>`_ or the `LLVM Web Site <https://llvm.org>`_.

Note that if you are reading this file from a Git checkout or the
main Libc++ web page, this document applies to the *next* release, not
the current one. To see the release notes for a specific release, please
see the `releases page <https://llvm.org/releases/>`_.

What's New in Libc++ 21.0.0?
==============================

Implemented Papers
------------------

- N4258: Cleaning-up noexcept in the Library (`Github <https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues/99937>`__)

- P1361R2: Integration of chrono with text formatting (`Github <https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues/100014>`__)
- P2255R2: A type trait to detect reference binding to temporary (implemented the type traits only) (`Github <https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues/105180>`__)
- P2562R1: ``constexpr`` Stable Sorting (`Github <https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues/105360>`__)
- P0472R3: Put std::monostate in <utility> (`Github <https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues/127874>`__)
- P1222R4: A Standard ``flat_set`` (`Github <https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues/105193>`__)
- P3247R2: Deprecate the notion of trivial types (`Github <https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues/118387>`__)

Improvements and New Features
-----------------------------

- The ``std::ranges::{copy, copy_n, copy_backward, move, move_backward, rotate}`` algorithms have been optimized for
  ``std::vector<bool>::iterator``, resulting in a performance improvement of up to 2000x.

- The ``std::ranges::equal`` algorithm has been optimized for ``std::vector<bool>::iterator``, resulting in a performance
  improvement of up to 188x.

- The ``std::ranges::swap_ranges`` algorithm has been optimized for ``std::vector<bool>::iterator``, resulting in a
  performance improvement of up to 611x.

- Updated formatting library to Unicode 16.0.0.

- The ``num_put::do_put`` integral overloads have been optimized, resulting in a performance improvement of up to 2.4x.

Deprecations and Removals
-------------------------

- ``std::is_pod`` and ``std::is_pod_v`` are deprecated in C++20 and later.

- ``std::is_trivial`` and ``std::is_trivial_v`` are deprecated in C++26 and later.

Potentially breaking changes
----------------------------

- The implementation of ``num_put::do_put`` has been replaced to improve the performance, which can lead to different
  output when printing pointers.

Upcoming Deprecations and Removals
----------------------------------

LLVM 22

- TODO


ABI Affecting Changes
---------------------

- When using GCC, the ``std`` namespace is now annotated with ``[[gnu::visibility("default")]]``. This may cause more
  symbols to be exported from shared libraries when building with ``-fvisibility=hidden``. This also fixes RTTI
  comparison between shared libraries, since all RTTI has the correct visibility now. There is no behaviour change on
  Clang.


Build System Changes
--------------------

- TODO
