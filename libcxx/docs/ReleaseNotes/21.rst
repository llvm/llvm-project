   These are in-progress notes for the upcoming libc++ 20.0.0 release.
   Release notes for previous releases can be found on
   `the Download Page <https://releases.llvm.org/download.html>`_.

Introduction
============

This document contains the release notes for the libc++ C++ Standard Library,
part of the LLVM Compiler Infrastructure, release 20.0.0. Here we describe the
status of libc++ in some detail, including major improvements from the previous
release and new feature work. For the general LLVM release notes, see `the LLVM
documentation <https://llvm.org/docs/ReleaseNotes.html>`_. All LLVM releases may
be downloaded from the `LLVM releases web site <https://llvm.org/releases/>`_.

For more information about libc++, please see the `Libc++ Web Site
<https://libcxx.llvm.org>`_ or the `LLVM Web Site <https://llvm.org>`_.

Note that if you are reading this file from a Git checkout or the
main Libc++ web page, this document applies to the *next* release, not
the current one. To see the release notes for a specific release, please
see the `releases page <https://llvm.org/releases/>`_.

What's New in Libc++ 21.0.0?
==============================

Improvements and New Features
-----------------------------

- The ``std::ranges::{copy, copy_n, copy_backward, move, move_backward, rotate}`` algorithms have been optimized for
  ``std::vector<bool>::iterator``, resulting in a performance improvement of up to 2000x.

- The ``std::ranges::equal`` algorithm has been optimized for ``std::vector<bool>::iterator``, resulting in a performance
  improvement of up to 188x.

- The ``std::ranges::swap_ranges`` algorithm has been optimized for ``std::vector<bool>::iterator``, resulting in a
  performance improvement of up to 611x.

- Updated formatting library to Unicode 16.0.0.

- The ``num_put::do_put`` integral overloads have been optimized, resulting in a performance improvement of up to 2.4x.

- The ``std::stable_sort`` algorithm uses radix sort for floating-point types now, which can improve the performance
  up to 10x, depending on type of sorted elements and the initial state of the sorted array.

- The segmented iterator optimization for ``std::for_each`` has been backported to C++11. Previously it was only available
  in C++23 and later.

- The ``std::for_each_n`` algorithm has been optimized for segmented iterators, resulting in a performance improvement of
  up to 17.7x for ``std::deque<short>`` iterators, and up to 13.9x for ``std::join_view<vector<vector<short>>>`` iterators.

Deprecations and Removals
-------------------------

- ``std::is_pod`` and ``std::is_pod_v`` are deprecated in C++20 and later.

- ``std::is_trivial`` and ``std::is_trivial_v`` are deprecated in C++26 and later.

- The ``_LIBCPP_VERBOSE_ABORT_NOT_NOEXCEPT`` has been removed, making ``std::__libcpp_verbose_abort``
  unconditionally ``noexcept``.

- libc++ no longer adds ``constexpr`` to ``std::hash<std::vector<bool, A>>::operator()``, as the ``constexpr`` addition
  since C++20 was an unintended extension.

- TODO: The non-conforming extension ``packaged_task::result_type`` has been removed in LLVM 21.

Potentially breaking changes
----------------------------

- The implementation of ``num_put::do_put`` has been replaced to improve the performance, which can lead to different
  output when printing pointers.

Announcements About Future Releases
-----------------------------------

LLVM 22
~~~~~~~

- The status of the C++03 implementation will be frozen after the LLVM 21 release. This means that starting in LLVM 22,
  non-critical bug fixes may not be back-ported to C++03, including LWG issues. C++03 is a legacy platform, where most
  projects are no longer actively maintained. To reduce the amount of fixes required to keep such legacy projects
  compiling with up-to-date toolchains, libc++ will aim to freeze the status of the headers in C++03 mode to avoid
  unintended breaking changes. See https://discourse.llvm.org/t/rfc-freezing-c-03-headers-in-libc for more details.

  If you are using C++03 in your project, you should consider moving to a newer version of the Standard to get the most
  out of libc++.


ABI Affecting Changes
---------------------

- When using GCC, the ``std`` namespace is now annotated with ``[[gnu::visibility("default")]]``. This may cause more
  symbols to be exported from shared libraries when building with ``-fvisibility=hidden``. This also fixes RTTI
  comparison between shared libraries, since all RTTI has the correct visibility now. There is no behaviour change on
  Clang.


Build System Changes
--------------------

- TODO
