   These are in-progress notes for the upcoming libc++ 19.0.0 release.
   Release notes for previous releases can be found on

Introduction
============

This document contains the release notes for the libc++ C++ Standard Library,
part of the LLVM Compiler Infrastructure, release 19.0.0. Here we describe the
status of libc++ in some detail, including major improvements from the previous
release and new feature work. For the general LLVM release notes, see `the LLVM
documentation <https://llvm.org/docs/ReleaseNotes.html>`_. All LLVM releases may
be downloaded from the `LLVM releases web site <https://llvm.org/releases/>`_.

For more information about libc++, please see the `Libc++ Web Site
<https://libcxx.llvm.org>`_ or the `LLVM Web Site <https://llvm.org>`_.

Note that if you are reading this file from a Git checkout or the
main Libc++ web page, this document applies to the *next* release, not
the current one. To see the release notes for a specific release, please
see the `releases page <https://llvm.org/releases/>`_.

Improvements and New Features
-----------------------------

- The performance of growing ``std::vector`` has been improved for trivially relocatable types.
- A lot of types are considered trivially relocatable now, including ``vector`` and ``string``.
- The performance of ``ranges::fill`` and ``ranges::fill_n`` has been improved for ``vector<bool>::iterator``\s,
  resulting in a performance increase of up to 1400x.
- The ``std::mismatch`` algorithm has been optimized for integral types, which can lead up to 40x performance
  improvements.

- The ``std::ranges::minmax`` algorithm has been optimized for integral types, resulting in a performance increase of
  up to 100x.

- The ``_LIBCPP_ENABLE_CXX26_REMOVED_STRSTREAM`` macro has been added to make the declarations in ``<strstream>`` available.

- The ``_LIBCPP_ENABLE_CXX26_REMOVED_WSTRING_CONVERT`` macro has been added to make the declarations in ``<locale>``
  available.

- The formatting library is updated to Unicode 15.1.0.

Deprecations and Removals
-------------------------

- The C++20 synchronization library (``<barrier>``, ``<latch>``, ``atomic::wait``, etc.) has been deprecated
  in language modes prior to C++20. If you are using these features prior to C++20, please update to ``-std=c++20``.
  In LLVM 20, the C++20 synchronization library will be removed entirely in language modes prior to C++20.

- ``_LIBCPP_DISABLE_NODISCARD_EXT`` has been removed. ``[[nodiscard]]`` applications are now unconditional.
  This decision is based on LEWGs discussion on `P3122 <https://wg21.link/P3122>` and `P3162 <https://wg21.link/P3162>`
  to not use ``[[nodiscard]]`` in the standard.

- TODO: The ``LIBCXX_ENABLE_ASSERTIONS`` CMake variable that was used to enable the safe mode has been deprecated and setting
  it triggers an error; use the ``LIBCXX_HARDENING_MODE`` CMake variable with the value ``extensive`` instead. Similarly,
  the ``_LIBCPP_ENABLE_ASSERTIONS`` macro has been deprecated (setting it to ``1`` still enables the extensive mode in
  the LLVM 19 release while also issuing a deprecation warning). See :ref:`the hardening documentation
  <using-hardening-modes>` for more details.

- The base template for ``std::char_traits`` has been removed in LLVM 19. If you are using ``std::char_traits`` with
  types other than ``char``, ``wchar_t``, ``char8_t``, ``char16_t``, ``char32_t`` or a custom character type for which you
  specialized ``std::char_traits``, your code will stop working. The Standard does not mandate that a base template is
  provided, and such a base template is bound to be incorrect for some types, which could currently cause unexpected behavior
  while going undetected.

- The ``_LIBCPP_ENABLE_NARROWING_CONVERSIONS_IN_VARIANT`` macro that changed the behavior for narrowing conversions
  in ``std::variant`` has been removed in LLVM 19.

- The ``_LIBCPP_ENABLE_CXX20_REMOVED_ALLOCATOR_MEMBERS`` and ``_LIBCPP_ENABLE_CXX20_REMOVED_ALLOCATOR_VOID_SPECIALIZATION``
  macros have been removed in LLVM 19.

- The ``_LIBCPP_ENABLE_CXX17_REMOVED_FEATURES`` and ``_LIBCPP_ENABLE_CXX20_REMOVED_FEATURES`` macros have
  been removed in LLVM 19. C++17 and C++20 removed features can still be re-enabled individually.

- The ``_LIBCPP_INLINE_VISIBILITY`` and ``_VSTD`` macros have been removed in LLVM 19.

- The ``_LIBCPP_ATOMIC_ONLY_USE_BUILTINS`` configuration option has been removed in LLVM 19. This should not affect
  many users, except perhaps users using the library with ``-ffreestanding`` with a toolchain where compiler-rt or
  libatomic is not available. If you are one such user, please reach out to the libc++ developers so we can collaborate
  on a path for supporting atomics properly on freestanding platforms.

- LWG3430 disallow implicit conversion of the source arguments to ``std::filesystem::path`` when
  constructing ``std::basic_*fstream``. This effectively removes the possibility to directly construct
  a ``std::basic_*fstream`` from a ``std::basic_string_view``, a input-iterator or a C-string, instead
  you can construct a temporary ``std::basic_string``. This change has been applied to C++17 and later.

- The ``_LIBCPP_DISABLE_ADDITIONAL_DIAGNOSTICS`` macro has been removed and is not honored anymore. Additional
  warnings provided by libc++ as a matter of QoI will now be provided unconditionally.

- libc++ no longer supports ``std::allocator<const T>`` and containers of ``const``-qualified element type, such
  as ``std::vector<const T>`` and ``std::list<const T>``. This used to be supported as an undocumented extension.
  If you were using ``std::vector<const T>``, replace it with ``std::vector<T>`` instead. The
  ``_LIBCPP_ENABLE_REMOVED_ALLOCATOR_CONST`` macro can be defined to temporarily re-enable this extension as
  folks transition their code. This macro will be honored for one released and ignored starting in LLVM 20.
  To assist with the clean-up process, consider running your code through Clang Tidy, with
  `std-allocator-const <https://clang.llvm.org/extra/clang-tidy/checks/portability/std-allocator-const.html>`
  enabled.


Upcoming Deprecations and Removals
----------------------------------

LLVM 20
~~~~~~~

- The ``LIBCXX_ENABLE_ASSERTIONS`` CMake variable and the ``_LIBCPP_ENABLE_ASSERTIONS`` macro that were used to enable
  the safe mode will be removed in LLVM 20.

LLVM 21
~~~~~~~
TODO


ABI Affecting Changes
---------------------

- The optional POSIX macro ``ENODATA`` has been deprecated in C++ and POSIX 2017. The
  ``random_device`` could throw a ``system_error`` with this value. It now
  throws ``ENOMSG``.


Build System Changes
--------------------

- The ``LIBCXX_EXECUTOR`` and ``LIBCXXABI_EXECUTOR`` CMake variables have been removed. Please
  set ``LIBCXX_TEST_PARAMS`` to ``executor=<...>`` instead.

- The Cmake variable ``LIBCXX_ENABLE_CLANG_TIDY`` has been removed. The build system has been changed
  to automatically detect the presence of ``clang-tidy`` and the required ``Clang`` libraries.

- The CMake options ``LIBCXX_INSTALL_MODULES`` now defaults to ``ON``.
