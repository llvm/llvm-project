   These are in-progress notes for the upcoming libc++ 18.0.0 release.
   Release notes for previous releases can be found on
   `the Download Page <https://releases.llvm.org/download.html>`_.

Introduction
============

This document contains the release notes for the libc++ C++ Standard Library,
part of the LLVM Compiler Infrastructure, release 18.0.0. Here we describe the
status of libc++ in some detail, including major improvements from the previous
release and new feature work. For the general LLVM release notes, see `the LLVM
documentation <https://llvm.org/docs/ReleaseNotes.html>`_. All LLVM releases may
be downloaded from the `LLVM releases web site <https://llvm.org/releases/>`_.

For more information about libc++, please see the `Libc++ Web Site
<https://libcxx.llvm.org>`_ or the `LLVM Web Site <https://llvm.org>`_.

Note that if you are reading this file from a Git checkout or the
main Libc++ web page, this document applies to the *next* release, not
the current one. To see the release notes for a specific release, please
see the `releases page <https://llvm.org/releases/>`_.

What's New in Libc++ 18.0.0?
==============================


Implemented Papers
------------------

- P2497R0 - Testing for success or failure of ``<charconv>`` functions
- P2697R1 - Interfacing ``bitset`` with ``string_view``


Improvements and New Features
-----------------------------


Deprecations and Removals
-------------------------

- The base template for ``std::char_traits`` has been removed. If you are using
  ``std::char_traits`` with types other than ``char``, ``wchar_t``, ``char8_t``,
  ``char16_t``, ``char32_t`` or a custom character type for which you
  specialized ``std::char_traits``, your code will no longer work. The Standard
  does not mandate that a base template is provided, and such a base template is
  bound to be incorrect for some types, which could previously cause unexpected
  behavior while going undetected.

Upcoming Deprecations and Removals
----------------------------------

LLVM 18
~~~~~~~

- The ``_LIBCPP_AVAILABILITY_CUSTOM_VERBOSE_ABORT_PROVIDED`` macro will not be honored anymore in LLVM 18.
  Please see the updated documentation about the safe libc++ mode and in particular the ``_LIBCPP_VERBOSE_ABORT``
  macro for details.

- The headers ``<experimental/deque>``, ``<experimental/forward_list>``, ``<experimental/list>``,
  ``<experimental/map>``, ``<experimental/memory_resource>``, ``<experimental/regex>``, ``<experimental/set>``,
  ``<experimental/string>``, ``<experimental/unordered_map>``, ``<experimental/unordered_set>``,
  and ``<experimental/vector>`` will be removed in LLVM 18, as all their contents will have been implemented in
  namespace ``std`` for at least two releases.

ABI Affecting Changes
---------------------

- The symbol of a non-visible function part of ``std::system_error`` was removed.
  This is not a breaking change as the private function ``__init`` was never referenced internally outside of the dylib

- This release of libc++ added missing visibility annotations on some types in the library. Users compiling with
  ``-fvisbility=hidden`` may notice that additional type infos from libc++ are being exported from their ABI. This is
  the correct behavior in almost all cases since exporting the RTTI is required for these types to work properly with
  dynamic_cast, exceptions and other mechanisms across binaries. However, if you intend to use libc++ purely as an
  internal implementation detail (i.e. you use libc++ as a static archive and never export libc++ symbols from your ABI)
  and you notice changes to your exported symbols list, then this means that you were not properly preventing libc++
  symbols from being part of your ABI.

Build System Changes
--------------------
