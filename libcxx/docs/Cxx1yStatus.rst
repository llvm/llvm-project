Overview
================================

In April 2013, the C++ standard committee approved the draft for the next version of the C++ standard, initially known as "C++1y".

The draft standard includes papers and issues that were voted on at the previous three meetings (Kona, Portland, and Bristol).

In August 2014, this draft was approved by ISO as C++14.
