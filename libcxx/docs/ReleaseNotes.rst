.. warning::

   These are in-progress notes for the upcoming libc++ 16 release.
   Release notes for previous releases can be found on
   `the Download Page <https://releases.llvm.org/download.html>`_.

Introduction
============

This document contains the release notes for the libc++ C++ Standard Library,
part of the LLVM Compiler Infrastructure, release 16.0.0. Here we describe the
status of libc++ in some detail, including major improvements from the previous
release and new feature work. For the general LLVM release notes, see `the LLVM
documentation <https://llvm.org/docs/ReleaseNotes.html>`_. All LLVM releases may
be downloaded from the `LLVM releases web site <https://llvm.org/releases/>`_.

For more information about libc++, please see the `Libc++ Web Site
<https://libcxx.llvm.org>`_ or the `LLVM Web Site <https://llvm.org>`_.

Note that if you are reading this file from a Git checkout or the
main Libc++ web page, this document applies to the *next* release, not
the current one. To see the release notes for a specific release, please
see the `releases page <https://llvm.org/releases/>`_.

What's New in Libc++ 16.0.0?
============================

Implemented Papers
------------------
- P2499R0 - ``string_view`` range constructor should be ``explicit``
- P2417R2 - A more constexpr bitset
- P2445R1 - ``std::forward_like``
- P2273R3 - Making ``std::unique_ptr`` constexpr
- P0591R4 - Utility functions to implement uses-allocator construction

Improvements and New Features
-----------------------------
- Declarations of ``std::c8rtomb()`` and ``std::mbrtoc8()`` from P0482R6 are
  now provided when implementations in the global namespace are provided by
  the C library.
- Implemented ``<memory_resource>`` header from C++17

Deprecations and Removals
-------------------------
- ``unary_function`` and ``binary_function`` are no longer provided in C++17 and newer Standard modes.
  They can be re-enabled with ``_LIBCPP_ENABLE_CXX17_REMOVED_UNARY_BINARY_FUNCTION``.

- Several incidental transitive includes have been removed from libc++. Those
  includes are removed based on the language version used. Incidental transitive
  inclusions of the following headers have been removed:

  - C++20: ``chrono``
  - C++2b: ``algorithm``, ``array``, ``atomic``, ``bit``, ``chrono``,
    ``climits``, ``cmath``, ``compare``, ``concepts``, ``cstdarg`, ``cstddef``,
    ``cstdint``, ``cstdlib``, ``cstring``, ``ctime``, ``exception``,
    ``functional``, ``initializer_list``, ``iosfwd``, ``iterator``, ``limits``,
    ``memory``, ``new``, ``numeric``, ``optional``, ``ratio``, ``stdexcept``,
    ``string``, ``tuple``, ``type_traits``, ``typeinfo``, ``unordered_map``,
    ``utility``, ``variant``, ``vector``.

  Users can also remove all incidental transitive includes by defining
  ``_LIBCPP_REMOVE_TRANSITIVE_INCLUDES`` regardless of the language version
  in use. Note that in the future, libc++ reserves the right to remove
  incidental transitive includes more aggressively, in particular regardless
  of the language version in use.

- The legacy testing system for libc++, libc++abi and libunwind has been removed.
  All known clients have been migrated to the new configuration system, but please
  reach out to the libc++ developers if you find something missing in the new
  configuration system.

- The functions ``to_chars`` and ``from_chars`` for integral types are
  available starting with C++17. Libc++ offered these functions in C++11 and
  C++14 as an undocumented extension. This extension makes it hard to implement
  the C++23 paper that makes these functions ``constexpr``, therefore the
  extension has been removed.

Upcoming Deprecations and Removals
----------------------------------

API Changes
-----------
- The comparison operators on ``thread::id`` are now defined as free-standing
  functions instead of as hidden friends, in conformance with the C++ standard.
  Also see `issue 56187 <https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues/56187>`_.

- ``_LIBCPP_ENABLE_NODISCARD`` and ``_LIBCPP_DISABLE_NODISCARD_AFTER_CXX17`` are no longer respected.
  Any standards-required ``[[nodiscard]]`` applications in C++20 are now always enabled. Any extended applications
  are now enabled by default and can be disabled by defining ``_LIBCPP_DISABLE_NODISCARD_EXT``.

- ``_LIBCPP_VERSION`` was previously defined to e.g. ``15001`` to represent LLVM 15.0.01, but this value had been
  left undocumented. Starting with LLVM 16, ``_LIBCPP_VERSION`` will contain the version of LLVM represented as
  ``XXYYZZ``. In other words, ``_LIBCPP_VERSION`` is gaining a digit. This should not be an issue for existing
  code, since using e.g. ``_LIBCPP_VERSION > 15000`` will still give the right answer now that ``_LIBCPP_VERSION``
  is defined as e.g. ``160000`` (with one more digit).

ABI Affecting Changes
---------------------
- In freestanding mode, ``atomic<small enum class>`` does not contain a lock byte anymore if the platform
  can implement lockfree atomics for that size. More specifically, in LLVM <= 11.0.1, an ``atomic<small enum class>``
  would not contain a lock byte. This was broken in LLVM >= 12.0.0, where it started including a lock byte despite
  the platform supporting lockfree atomics for that size. Starting in LLVM 15.0.1, the ABI for these types has been
  restored to what it used to be (no lock byte), which is the most efficient implementation.

  This ABI break only affects users that compile with ``-ffreestanding``, and only for ``atomic<T>`` where ``T``
  is a non-builtin type that could be lockfree on the platform. See https://llvm.org/D133377 for more details.

Build System Changes
--------------------
- Support for ``libcxx``, ``libcxxabi`` and ``libunwind`` in ``LLVM_ENABLE_PROJECTS`` has officially
  been removed. Instead, please build according to :ref:`these instructions <build instructions>`.
