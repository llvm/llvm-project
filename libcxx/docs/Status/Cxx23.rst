Overview
================================

In November 2020, the C++ standard committee adopted the first changes to the next version of the C++ standard, known here as "C++2b" (probably to be C++23).
In February 2023, the C++ standard committee approved this draft, and sent it to ISO for approval as C++23.

This page shows the status of libc++; the status of clang's support of the language features is `here <https://clang.llvm.org/cxx_status.html#cxx23>`__.

The groups that have contributed papers:

-  CWG - Core Language Working group
-  LWG - Library working group
-  SG1 - Study group #1 (Concurrency working group)
