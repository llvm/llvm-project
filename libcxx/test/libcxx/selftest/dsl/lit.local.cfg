# Since we try to pass substitutions as-is to some tests, we must "escape"
# them in case they contain other substitutions. Otherwise, the substitutions
# will be fully expanded when passed to the tests. For example, we want an
# %{exec} substitution that contains `--dependencies %{file_dependencies}`
# to be passed as-is, without substituting the file dependencies. This way,
# the test itself can use populate %{file_dependencies} as it sees fit, and
# %{exec} will respect it.
#
# To solve this problem, we add base64 encoded versions of substitutions just
# in this directory. We then base64-decode them from the tests when we need to.
# Another option would be to have a way to prevent expansion in Lit itself.

base64Encode = lambda s: base64.b64encode(s.encode()).decode()
