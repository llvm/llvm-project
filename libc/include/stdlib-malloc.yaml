# Note: glibc's <stdlib.h> and <malloc.h> both have these, which are
# currently missing here:
#  - name: reallocarray
#  - name: memalign
#  - name: valloc
# Each of those glibc headers also has related functions the other lacks.
# Only the common subset is mentioned here for future consideration.
