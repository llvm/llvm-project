==================
The LLVM C Library
==================

.. warning::
  LLVM-libc is not yet ABI stable; currently only static linking is supported.
  LLVM-libc developers retain the right to modify the ABI of types used
  throughout the library. Another libc should be preferred if ABI stability is
  a requirement.

.. note::
  LLVM-libc is not fully complete right now. Some programs may fail to build due
  to missing functions. If you would like to help us finish LLVM-libc, check
  out "`Contributing to the libc project <contributing.html>`__" in the sidebar
  or ask on `discord <https://discord.com/channels/636084430946959380/636732994891284500>`__.

Introduction
============

LLVM-libc aspires to a unique place in the software ecosystem.  The goals are:

- Fully compliant with current C23 and POSIX.1-2024 standards.
- Easily decomposed and embedded: Supplement or replace system C library
  functionality easily.  This is useful to get consistent math precision across
  systems, or updated memory operations for newer microarchitectures.  These
  pieces will work on Linux, MacOS, Windows, and Fuchsia.
- The creation of fully static binaries without license implications.
- Increase whole program optimization opportunities for static binaries through
  ability to inline math and memory operations.
- Reduce coding errors by coding in modern C++ through the use of lightweight
  containers during coding that can be optimized away at runtime.
- Permit fuzzing and sanitizer instrumentation of user binaries including the
  libc functions.
- A complete testsuite that tests both the public interface and internal
  algorithms.
