Platform Support
================

Development is currently mostly focused on Linux.  MacOS and Windows has
partial support, but has bitrot and isn't being tested continuously.

LLVM-libc is currently being integrated into Android and Fuchsia operating
systems via `overlay mode <overlay_mode.html>`__.

For Linux, we support kernel versions as listed on
`kernel.org <https://kernel.org/>`_, including ``longterm`` (not past EOL
date), ``stable``, and ``mainline`` versions. We actively adopt new features
from ``linux-next``.

For Windows, we plan to support products within their lifecycle. Please refer to 
`Search Product and Services Lifecycle Information <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle/products/?products=windows>`_ for more information.

LLVM-libc does not guarantee backward compatibility with operating systems that
have reached their EOL. Compatibility patches for obsolete operating systems
will not be accepted.

For GPU, reference `our GPU docs <gpu/index.html>`__.
