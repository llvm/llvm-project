Architecture Support
====================

The currently continuously tested architectures are:

* aarch64
* amdgpu
* arm
* nvptx
* riscv32
* riscv64
* x86_64

i386 support is [in the works](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues/93709).

See "`Bringup on a New OS or Architecture <porting.html>`__" for more
information. Please do first file a bug in
`our issue tracker <https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/labels/libc>`__ before
starting a port that you plan to upstream.
