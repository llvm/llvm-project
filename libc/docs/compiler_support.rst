Compiler Support
================

``LLVM libc`` compiles from both ``Clang`` and ``GCC`` but for maximum
performance we recommand using ``Clang``.

Indeed, some memory function implementations rely on `compiler intrinsics`__
that are not currently available in ``GCC``.
As such we cannot guarantee optimal performance for these functions.

For platforms where only ``GCC`` is natively available but maximum performance
is required it is possible to bootstrap ``Clang`` with ``GCC`` and then use
``Clang`` to build the '`libc``" project.

Minimum supported versions
==========================

 - ``Clang 11``
 - ``GCC 12.2``
