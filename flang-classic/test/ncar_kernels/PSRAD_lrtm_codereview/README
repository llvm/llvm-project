* kernel and supporting files
	- lrtm subroutine is located at line #61  of mo_lrtm_driver.f90 file
	- program statement or subroutine call is on line #320 in mo_psrad_interface.f90
	- call_hierarchy.png is a diagram showing function call hierarchy in PSrad
	- The other files are subset of PSrad source files that contain information to execute lrtm

* compilation and execution
	- Place all files in a directory
 	- Adjust FC and FFLAGS macros in Makefile to use a specific compiler. Default compiler is ifort
	- run "make"

* verification
 	- "make" command will run kernel and print verification output on screen
 	- Verification is considered as pass if it shows "PASSED" or "Normalized RMS of difference" is around machine-precision (apprx. 10e-15)
 	- Verification check is performed using three data files- lrtm.1, lrtm.10 and lrtm.50. The data files are generated from running PSrad using Intel 15.0 compiler with "-O3 -xHost" compiler flags

* performance measurement
	- The kernel prints elapsed time (in seconds)  as the time taken to execute the kernel
	- The elapsed time is printed three times for each kernel executed using the three data files
