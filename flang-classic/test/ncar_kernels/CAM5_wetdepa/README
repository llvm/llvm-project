WETDEPA_V2 driver
-----------------

The Wetdepa_v2 driver represents a piece of code that consumes a relatively 
large amount of time in the CAM5 model.  In particular in its original form 
it consumed 2.5% of CAM5-SE @ ne=16 on 384 cores.  This code was identified
using Extrae, Paraver, and BSC clustering and folding tools as consuming 
a large amount of time and executing rather poorly.  In particular the original 
version did not vectorize due to unnecessary if loops.  Two versions of the 
subroutine are provide:

	wetdep_orig.F90:	original verison
	wetdep.F90:		modified version

A makefile is provided which will build a modified version of the driver 
'wetdepa_driver', and the original version of the driver 'wetdepa_orig_driver'.
