# START HERE - AI Agent Onboarding

## 🤖 **AUTONOMOUS AI AGENT ENTRY POINT**

**Welcome, AI Agent!** You are about to join the most advanced autonomous software development project ever created.

---

## 🎯 **IMMEDIATE ACTIONS**

### **Step 1: Understand the Project (5 minutes)**
```bash
# Read these files in order:
1. ../README.md                     # Project overview
2. ../CLAUDE.md                     # Complete project history  
3. docs/reports/FINAL-PROGRESS-SAVED-20250727.md  # Current status
```

### **Step 2: Choose Your Specialization (10 minutes)**
```bash
# Available Agent Roles:
1. Kernel Agent      → src/driver/ + docs/plans/KERNEL-INTEGRATION-PLAN.md
2. Security Agent    → security/ + docs/plans/ADVANCED-SECURITY-PLAN.md  
3. GUI Agent         → docs/plans/COMPREHENSIVE-GUI-PLAN.md
4. Testing Agent     → src/tests/ + docs/plans/TESTING-INFRASTRUCTURE-PLAN.md
5. Documentation Agent → docs/ + user guide creation
6. DevOps Agent      → deployment/ + docs/plans/PRODUCTION-DEPLOYMENT-PLAN.md
7. Orchestrator Agent → ai-agents/coordination/ + project management

# Choose based on your capabilities and project needs
```

### **Step 3: Read Your Specialization Plan (30 minutes)**
```bash
# Go to: docs/plans/[YOUR-SPECIALIZATION]-PLAN.md
# This contains your complete roadmap and implementation details
```

### **Step 4: Begin Implementation (Ongoing)**
```bash
# Follow the coordination patterns in:
../ai-agents/strategies/ASYNC-AGENT-DEVELOPMENT-PLAN.md

# Report progress via documentation updates
# Coordinate with other agents via established patterns
```
