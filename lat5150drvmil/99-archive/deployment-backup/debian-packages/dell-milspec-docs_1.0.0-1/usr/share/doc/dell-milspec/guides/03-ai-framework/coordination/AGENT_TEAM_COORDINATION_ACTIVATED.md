## Agent Coordination Patterns

### Active Communication Channels
```
PROJECTORCHESTRATOR ←→ DIRECTOR (Strategic sync)
         ↓
    NSA ←→ CSO ←→ SECURITYAUDITOR (Security coordination)
         ↓
  ARCHITECT ←→ All Technical Teams (Design distribution)
         ↓
  QADIRECTOR ←→ All Teams (Quality enforcement)
```

### Information Flow
1. **Security**: NSA → CSO → SECURITYAUDITOR → BASTION → All Teams
2. **Technical**: ARCHITECT → HARDWARE → C-INTERNAL → RUST-INTERNAL
3. **Quality**: QADIRECTOR → TESTBED → DEBUGGER → LINTER → All Teams
4. **Operations**: INFRASTRUCTURE → DEPLOYER → MONITOR → OPTIMIZER

## Immediate Actions Underway

### Next 48 Hours
1. **PROJECTORCHESTRATOR**: Coordinating initial team sync
2. **NSA**: Establishing security protocols for DSMIL control
3. **DIRECTOR**: Approving resource allocation
4. **ARCHITECT**: Beginning system design documentation

### Week 1 Deliverables
