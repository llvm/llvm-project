## 🚨 **CRITICAL GAPS FOR IMMEDIATE ATTENTION**

### **1. Security Audit Framework**
Without formal security auditing, the platform cannot claim military-grade security. This is essential for credibility and adoption.

### **2. Export Control Compliance**
Military technology faces strict export controls. Without proper compliance planning, international distribution could face legal challenges.

### **3. Production Monitoring**
A security platform without comprehensive monitoring is blind to threats. This is critical for production deployment.

### **4. Incident Response**
Security platforms must handle compromises gracefully. Without incident response planning, a single breach could be catastrophic.
