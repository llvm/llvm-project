	  This driver provides support for Dell military specification
	  features found on certain Dell Latitude models (such as the
	  5450 MIL-SPEC JRTC1 variant).

	  Features include:
	  - Mode 5 security levels (Standard/Enhanced/Paranoid)
	  - DSMIL subsystem activation (12 military devices)
	  - Hardware intrusion detection
	  - Secure wipe capabilities
	  - Integration with TPM for attestation
	  - Hardware crypto support (ATECC608B)

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module
	  will be called dell-milspec.

config DELL_MILSPEC_CRYPTO
	bool "Dell MIL-SPEC Hardware Crypto Support"
	depends on DELL_MILSPEC
	depends on I2C
	default y
	help
	  Enable support for the ATECC608B hardware crypto chip found
	  on some Dell military specification systems. This provides
	  hardware-accelerated cryptographic operations and secure
	  key storage.

	  If unsure, say Y.

config DELL_MILSPEC_TPM
	bool "Dell MIL-SPEC TPM Integration"
	depends on DELL_MILSPEC
	depends on TCG_TPM
	default y
	help
	  Enable TPM integration for Dell military specification
	  features. This allows Mode 5 configurations and DSMIL
	  states to be measured into TPM PCRs for attestation.

	  If unsure, say Y.

config DELL_MILSPEC_DEBUG
	bool "Dell MIL-SPEC Debug Support"
	depends on DELL_MILSPEC
	depends on DEBUG_FS
	default n
	help
	  Enable debug support for the Dell military specification
	  driver. This creates debugfs entries for monitoring internal
	  state and events. This should only be enabled for debugging
	  and development.

	  If unsure, say N.

config DELL_MILSPEC_FORCE_LOAD
	bool "Force Dell MIL-SPEC Driver Load"
	depends on DELL_MILSPEC
	depends on EXPERT
	default n
	help
	  Force the Dell military specification driver to load even
	  on non-Dell systems or systems without proper DMI strings.
	  This is only for development and testing purposes.

	  WARNING: Enabling this on non-compatible hardware may cause
	  system instability.

	  If unsure, say N.

config DELL_MILSPEC_EARLY_INIT
	bool "Dell MIL-SPEC Early Initialization"
	depends on DELL_MILSPEC
	default y
	help
	  Enable early initialization of Dell military specification
	  features during boot. This allows features to be activated
	  before the main system is fully initialized.

	  If unsure, say Y.
