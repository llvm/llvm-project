# This file lists reviewers that are auto-assigned when a pull request modifies
# certain files or directories. If you add yourself to this file, you commit to
# reviewing a large fraction of pull requests in the relevant area.
#
# The GitHub "code owners" mechanism is used exclusively to auto-assign
# reviewers and does not carry significance beyond that. It is not necessary
# to receive an approval from a "code owner" in particular -- any LLVM project
# member can approve pull requests.
#
# Note that GitHub's concept of "code owner" is independent from LLVM's own
# "code owner" concept, they merely happen to share terminology. See
# https://llvm.org/docs/DeveloperPolicy.html#code-owners, as well as the
# CODE_OWNERS.txt files in the respective subproject directories.
