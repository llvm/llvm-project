# This file defines an action that builds the various Docker images used to run
# libc++ CI whenever modifications to those Docker files are pushed to `main`.
#
# The images are pushed to the LLVM package registry at https://github.com/orgs/llvm/packages
# and tagged appropriately. The selection of which Docker image version is used by the libc++
# CI nodes at any given point is controlled from the workflow files themselves.
