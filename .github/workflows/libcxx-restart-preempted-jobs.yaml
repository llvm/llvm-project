name: Restart Preempted Libc++ Workflow

# The libc++ builders run on preemptable VMs, which can be shutdown at any time.
# This workflow identifies when a workflow run was canceled due to the VM being preempted,
# and restarts the workflow run.

# We identify a canceled workflow run by checking the annotations of the check runs in the check suite,
# which should contain the message "The runner has received a shutdown signal."

# Note: If a job is both preempted and also contains a non-preemption failure, we do not restart the workflow.
