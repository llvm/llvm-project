# This file defines the Docker images used by various self-hosted runner groups used
# in the libc++ pre-merge testing pipeline.
#
# The images are specified this way instead of being in the workflow file due to a
# Kubernetes bug, as described in https://discourse.llvm.org/t/rfc-migrating-libc-premerge-testing-to-new-llvm-premerge-testing-infrastructure.
#
# When updating this file, the self-hosted runner sets are going to pick up the
# specified image after a short delay. The Docker images used are always the
# ones on the 'main' branch of the official LLVM GitHub repository.
