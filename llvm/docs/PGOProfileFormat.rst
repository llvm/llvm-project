Overview
==========

IR-based instrumentation (IRPGO) and its context-sensitive variant (CS-IRPGO)
inserts `llvm.instrprof.*` `code generator intrinsics <https://llvm.org/docs/LangRef.html#code-generator-intrinsics>`_
in LLVM IR to generate profiles. This document describes two binary profile
formats (raw and indexed) used by IR-based instrumentation.

.. note::

  Both the compiler-rt profiling infrastructure and profile format are general
  and could support other use cases (e.g., coverage and temporal profiling).
  This document will focus on IRPGO while briefly introducing other use cases
  with pointers.

Raw PGO Profile Format
========================

The raw PGO profile is generated by running the instrumented binary. It is a
memory dump of the profile data.

Two kinds of frequently used profile information are function's basic block
counters and its (various flavors of) value profiles. A function's profiled
information span across several sections in the profile.

General Storage Layout
-----------------------

A raw profile for an executable [1]_ consists of a profile header and several
sections. The storage layout is illustrated below. Generally, when raw profile
is read into an memory buffer, the actual byte offset of a section is inferred
from the section's order in the layout and size information of all sections
ahead of it.

.. note::
   Sections might be padded to meet platform-specific alignment requirements.
   For simplicity, header fields and data sections solely for padding purpose
   are omitted in the data layout graph above and the rest of this document.

Header
-------

``Magic``
  With the magic number, data consumer could detect profile format and
  endianness of the data, and quickly tells whether/how to continue reading.

``Version``
  The lower 32 bits specifies the actual version and the most significant 32
  bits specify the variant types of the profile. IRPGO and CS-IRPGO are two
  variant types.

``BinaryIdsSize``
  The byte size of binary id section.

``NumData``
  The number of per-function profile data control structures. The byte size of
  profile data section could be computed with this field.

``NumCounter``
  The number of entries in the profile counter section. The byte size of counter
  section could be computed with this field.

``NumBitmapBytes``
  The number of bytes in the profile bitmap section.

``NamesSize``
  The number of bytes in the name section.

``CountersDelta``
  Records the in-memory address difference between the data and counter section,
  i.e., `start(__llvm_prf_cnts) - start(__llvm_prf_data)`. It's used jointly
  with the in-memory address difference of profile data record and its counter
  to find the counter of a profile data record. Check out calculation-of-counter-offset_
  for details.

``BitmapDelta``
  Records the in-memory address difference between the data and bitmap section,
  i.e., `start(__llvm_prf_bits) - start(__llvm_prf_data)`. It's used jointly
  with the in-memory address difference of a profile data record and its bitmap
  to find the bitmap of a profile data record, in a similar to how counters are
  referenced as explained by calculation-of-counter-offset_ .

``NamesDelta``
  Records the in-memory address of compressed name section. Not used except for
  raw profile reader error checking.

``ValueKindLast``
  Records the number of value kinds. As of writing, two kinds of value profiles
  are supported. `IndirectCallTarget` is to profile the frequent callees of
  indirect call instructions and `MemOPSize` is for memory intrinsic function
  size profiling.

  The number of value kinds affects the byte size of per function profile data
  control structure.

Payload Sections
------------------

Binary Ids
^^^^^^^^^^^
Stores the binary ids of the instrumented binaries to associate binaries with
profiles for source code coverage. See `Binary Id RFC`_ for introduction.

.. _`Binary Id RFC`: https://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2021-June/151154.html

Profile Data
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This section stores per-function profile data control structure. The in-memory
representation of the control structure is `__llvm_profile_data` and the fields
are defined by `INSTRPROFDATA` macro. Some fields are used to reference data
from other sections in the profile. The fields are documented as follows:

``NameRef``
  The MD5 of the function's IRPGO name. IRPGO name has the format
  `[<filepath>;]<linkage-name>` where `<filepath>;` is provided for local-linkage
  functions to tell possibly identical function names.

``FuncHash``
  A fingerprint of the function's control flow graph.

``CounterPtr``
  The in-memory address difference between profile data and its corresponding counters.

``BitmapPtr``
  The in-memory address difference between profile data and its bitmap.

``FunctionPointer``
  Records the function address when instrumented binary runs. This is used to
  map the profiled callee address of indirect calls to the `NameRef` during
  conversion from raw to indexed profiles.

``Values``
  Represents value profiles in a two dimensional array. The number of elements
  in the first dimension is the number of instrumented value sites across all
  kinds. Each element in the first dimension is the head of a linked list, and
  the each element in the second dimension is linked list element, carrying
  `<profiled-value, count>` as payload. This is used by compiler runtime when
  writing out value profiles.

``NumCounters``
  The number of counters for the instrumented function.

``NumValueSites``
  This is an array of counters, and each counter represents the number of
  instrumented sites for a kind of value in the function.

``NumBitmapBytes``
  The number of bitmap bytes for the function.

Profile Counters
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For IRPGO [2]_, the counters within an instrumented function are stored contiguously
and in an order that is consistent with basic block selection in the instrumentation
pass.

.. _calculation-of-counter-offset:

So how are function counters associated with a function?

Basically, the profile reader iterates per-function control structure (from the
profile data section) and makes use of the recorded relative distances, as
illustrated below.

In the graph,

* The profile header records `CounterDelta` with the value as `start(__llvm_prf_cnts) - start(__llvm_prf_data)`.
  We will call it `CounterDeltaInitVal` below for convenience.
* For each profile data record, `CounterPtrN` is recorded as `start(Counter) - start(ProfileData)`.

Each time the reader advances to the next data record, it updates `CounterDelta` to minus the size of one `ProfileData`.

For the counter corresponding to the first data record, the byte offset
relative to the start of the counter section is calculated as `CounterPtr1 - CounterDeltaInitVal`.
When profile reader advances to the second data record, note `CounterDelta` is now `CounterDeltaInitVal - sizeof(ProfileData)`.
Thus the byte offset relative to the start of the counter section is calculated as `CounterPtr2 - (CounterDeltaInitVal - sizeof(ProfileData))`.

Bitmap
^^^^^^^
This section is used for source-based MC/DC code coverage. Check out `Bitmap RFC`_
if interested.

.. _`Bitmap RFC`: https://discourse.llvm.org/t/rfc-source-based-mc-dc-code-coverage/59244

Names
^^^^^^

This section contains the concatenated string of function IRPGO names. If
compressed, zlib compression algorithm is used.

Function names serve as keys in the PGO data hash table when raw profiles are
converted into indexed profiles. They are also crucial for `llvm-profdata` to
show the profiles in a human-readable way.

Value Profile Data
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This section contains the profile data for value profiling.

The value profiles corresponding to a profile data are serialized contiguously
as one record, and value profile records are stored in the same order as the
respective profile data, such that a raw profile reader advances the pointer to
profile data and the pointer to value profile records simutaneously [3]_ to find
value profiles for a per function, per cfg fingerprint profile data.

Header
--------

``Magic``
  The purpose of the magic number is to be able to quickly tell if the profile
  is an indexed profile.

``Version``
  Similar to raw profile version, the lower 32 bits specifies the version of the
  indexed profile and the most significant 32 bits are reserved to specify the
  variant types of the profile.

``HashType``
  The hashing scheme for on-disk hash table keys. Only MD5 hashing is used as of
  writing.

``HashOffset``
  An on-disk hash table stores the per-function profile records.
  Precisely speaking, `HashOffset` records the offset of this hash table's
  metadata (i.e., the number of buckets and entries), which follows right after
  the payload of the entire hash table.

``MemProfOffset``
  Records the byte offset of MemProf profiling data.

``BinaryIdOffset``
  Records the byte offset of binary id sections.

``TemporalProfTracesOffset``
  Records the byte offset of temporal profiles.

Payload Sections
------------------

(CS) Profile Summary
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This section is right after profile header. It stores the serialized profile
summary. For context-sensitive IRPGO, this section stores an additional profile
summary corresponding to the context-sensitive profiles.

Function PGO data
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This section stores functions and their PGO profiling data as an on-disk hash
table. The key of a hash table entry is function's PGO name, and the in-memory
representation of value is a map. The key of this map is CFG hash, and the value
is C++ struct `llvm::InstrProfRecord`. The C++ struct collects the profiling
information like counters and value profiles.

MemProf Profile data
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This section stores function's memory profiling data. See
`MemProf binary serialization format RFC`_ for the design.

.. _`MemProf binary serialization format RFC`: https://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2021-September/153007.html

Binary Ids
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The section to carry on binary-id information from raw profiles.

Temporal Profile Traces
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The section to carry on temporal profile information from raw profiles.
See `Temporal profiling RFC`_ for an overview.

.. _`Temporal profiling RFC`: https://discourse.llvm.org/t/rfc-temporal-profiling-extension-for-irpgo/68068

Profile Data Usage
=======================================

`llvm-profdata` is the command line tool to display and process profile data.
For supported usages, check out its `documentation <https://llvm.org/docs/CommandGuide/llvm-profdata.html>`_.


.. [1] A raw profile file could contain multiple raw profiles. Raw profile
   reader could parse all raw profiles from the file correctly.
.. [2] The counter section is used by a few variant types (like coverage and
   temporal profiling) and might have different semantics there.
.. [3] The step size of data pointer is the `sizeof(ProfileData)`, and the step
   size of value profile pointer is calcuated based on the number of collected
   values.
