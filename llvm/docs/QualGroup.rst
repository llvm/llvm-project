========================
LLVM Qualification Group
========================

Introduction
============

The LLVM Qualification Group is an open working group within the LLVM community. 
It was created to coordinate efforts around enabling the use of LLVM components 
in safety-critical applications such as those governed by ISO 26262 (automotive), 
DO-178C (aerospace), and EN 50128 (railways).

Motivation
==========

LLVM is increasingly used in safety-critical domains (e.g., automotive, aerospace, medical),
but currently lacks a shared structure to address the specific needs of functional safety, 
such as systematic assurance arguments, tool qualification artifacts, and their associated 
documentation.

An more open, upstream, reusable, and collaborative approach would benefit the wider ecosystem.
This group serves as a public forum for those interested in improving LLVMâ€™s suitability for
use in such environments.

Goals
=====

The Qualification Group aims to:

* Facilitate open discussion around tool confidence and qualification practices
* Identify areas for upstream improvements (e.g., traceability hooks, quality evidence)
* Share safety-relevant documentation and argumentation templates
* Coordinate efforts across users and vendors working toward similar goals
* Act as a point of contact for safety-related collaboration

The group is non-enforcing and does not control any part of the codebase.
All technical decisions remain subject to the standard LLVM review and governance process.

Participation
=============

Participation is open to anyone interested. The group currently coordinates via:

* LLVM Discourse (under the "Community" category): https://discourse.llvm.org/
* Public working sessions and collaborative documents
* [Details on working sessions will be shared soon on the GettingInvolved page]
* Informal discussions on the LLVM Community Discord server (channel to be announced)

Initial Contributors
====================

The initial participants include community members and industry contributors with experience
in compiler development, tool qualification, and functional safety. (To be filled in after PR review.)
