   These are in-progress notes for the upcoming LLVM 13 release.
   Release notes for previous releases can be found on
   `the Download Page <https://releases.llvm.org/download.html>`_.


Introduction
============

This document contains the release notes for the LLVM Compiler Infrastructure,
release 13.0.0.  Here we describe the status of LLVM, including major improvements
from the previous release, improvements in various subprojects of LLVM, and
some of the current users of the code.  All LLVM releases may be downloaded
from the `LLVM releases web site <https://llvm.org/releases/>`_.

For more information about LLVM, including information about the latest
release, please check out the `main LLVM web site <https://llvm.org/>`_.  If you
have questions or comments, the `LLVM Developer's Mailing List
<https://lists.llvm.org/mailman/listinfo/llvm-dev>`_ is a good place to send
them.

Note that if you are reading this file from a Git checkout or the main
LLVM web page, this document applies to the *next* release, not the current
one.  To see the release notes for a specific release, please see the `releases
page <https://llvm.org/releases/>`_.

Non-comprehensive list of changes in this release
=================================================
.. NOTE
   For small 1-3 sentence descriptions, just add an entry at the end of
   this list. If your description won't fit comfortably in one bullet
   point (e.g. maybe you would like to give an example of the
   functionality, or simply have a lot to talk about), see the `NOTE` below
   for adding a new subsection.


.. NOTE
   If you would like to document a larger change, then you can add a
   subsection about it right here. You can copy the following boilerplate
   and un-indent it (the indentation causes it to be inside this comment).

   Special New Feature
   -------------------

   Makes programs 10x faster by doing Special New Thing.

* Windows Control-flow Enforcement Technology: the ``-ehcontguard`` option now
  emits valid unwind entrypoints which are validated when the context is being
  set during exception handling.

Changes to the LLVM IR
----------------------

* The ``inalloca`` attribute now has a mandatory type field, similar
  to ``byval`` and ``sret``.

* The opaque pointer type ``ptr`` has been introduced. It is still in the
  process of being worked on and should not be used yet.

Changes to building LLVM
------------------------

* The build system now supports building multiple distributions, so that you can
  e.g. have one distribution containing just tools and another for libraries (to
  enable development). See :ref:`Multi-distribution configurations` for details.

Changes to TableGen
-------------------

Changes to the AArch64 Backend
------------------------------

* Introduced support for Armv9-A's Realm Management Extension.

Changes to the C API
--------------------

* The C API functions ``LLVMGetAlignment`` and ``LLVMSetAlignment`` now allow
  changing alignment on atomicrmw and cmpxchg instructions

* A new entry ``LLVMDIArgListMetadataKind`` was added to the
  ``LLVMMetadataKind`` enum, representing DIArgLists
  (`D88175 <https://reviews.llvm.org/D88175>`_)

* Type attributes have been added to LLVM-C, introducing
  LLVMCreateTypeAttribute, LLVMGetTypeAttributeValue and LLVMIsTypeAttribute.
  (`D977763' <https://reviews.llvm.org/D97763>`_)

* The ``LTO_API_VERSION`` was bumped to 28, introducing a new function
  ``lto_set_debug_options`` for parsing LTO debug options
  (`D92611 <https://reviews.llvm.org/D92611>`_)

* ``LLVMJITTargetSymbolFlags`` was renamed to ``LLVMJITSymbolTargetFlags``
  (`rG8d718a0bff73af066675a6258c01307937c33cf9
  <https://reviews.llvm.org/rG8d718a0bff73af066675a6258c01307937c33cf9>`_)

* The C API received support for creating custom ORCv2 MaterializationUnits and
  APIs to retrieve an LLJIT instance's linking layers. An ABI breaking change
  for ``LLVMOrcAbsoluteSymbols`` was introduced to make it consistent with
  ``LLVMOrcCreateCustomMaterializationUnit``.
  (`rGc8fc5e3ba942057d6c4cdcd1faeae69a28e7b671
  <https://reviews.llvm.org/rGc8fc5e3ba942057d6c4cdcd1faeae69a28e7b671>`_)

* The C API received support for adding ORCv2 object buffers directly to an object
  layer. (`rG7b73cd684a8d5fb44d34064200f10e2723085c33
  <https://reviews.llvm.org/rG7b73cd684a8d5fb44d34064200f10e2723085c33>`_)

* A breaking change to ``LLVMGetInlineAsm`` was introduced, adding a ninth
  argument ``LLVMBool CanThrow`` (`D95745 <https://reviews.llvm.org/D95745>`_)

* The C API received support for calling into the new pass manager.
  (`D102136 <https://reviews.llvm.org/D102136>`_)

* The C API function ``LLVMIntrinsicCopyOverloadedName`` has been deprecated.
  Please migrate to ``LLVMIntrinsicCopyOverloadedName2`` which takes an extra
  module argument and which also handles unnamed types.
  (`D99173 <https://reviews.llvm.org/D99173>`_)

* The C API received support for dumping objects from ORCv2
  (`rGcec8e69f01c3374cb38c6683058381b96fab8f89
  <https://reviews.llvm.org/rGcec8e69f01c3374cb38c6683058381b96fab8f89>`_)

* A breaking change to ``LLVMOrcObjectTransformLayerTransformFunction`` was
  introduced, changing the order of the function pointer's arguments.
  (`rG8962c68ad007a525f9daa987c99eda57e0d0069a
  <https://reviews.llvm.org/rG8962c68ad007a525f9daa987c99eda57e0d0069a>`_)

* The C API received support for accessing utilities from the LLJIT
  ``IRTransformLayer`` and ``ThreadSafeModule`` classes. (`D103855
  <https://reviews.llvm.org/D103855>`_)

* The C API received support for creating lazy-export MaterializationUnits
  (`D104672 <https://reviews.llvm.org/D104672>`_)

* The C API function ``LLVMPassBuilderOptionsSetCoroutines`` was removed because
  couroutine passes have been enabled by default. (`D105877
  <https://reviews.llvm.org/D105877>`_)

* ``comdat noduplicates`` was renamed to ``comdat nodeduplicate`` and as a
  result, ``LLVMNoDuplicatesComdatSelectionKind`` was renamed to
  ``LLVMNoDeduplicateComdatSelectionKind``. (`D106319
  <https://reviews.llvm.org/D106319>`_)

Changes to the Go bindings
--------------------------


Changes to the FastISel infrastructure
--------------------------------------

* FastISel no longer tracks killed registers, and instead leaves this to the
  register allocator. This means that ``hasTrivialKill()`` is removed, as well
  as the ``OpNIsKill`` parameters to the ``fastEmit_*()`` family of functions.

Changes to the DAG infrastructure
---------------------------------


Changes to the Debug Info
---------------------------------

During this release ...

  (`D94928 <https://reviews.llvm.org/D94928>`_)

* llvm-objdump supports ``-M {att,intel}`` now.
  ``--x86-asm-syntax`` is a deprecated internal option which will be removed in LLVM 14.0.0.
  (`D101695 <https://reviews.llvm.org/D101695>`_)

* The llvm-readobj short aliases ``-s`` (previously ``--sections``) and ``-t``
  (previously ``--syms``) have been changed to ``--syms`` and
  ``--section-details`` respectively, to match llvm-readelf.
  (`D105055 <https://reviews.llvm.org/D105055>`_)

* The llvm-nm short aliases ``-M`` (``--print-armap``), ``-U``
  (``--defined-only``), and ``-W`` (``--no-weak``) are now deprecated.
  Use the long form versions instead.
  The alias ``--just-symbol-name`` is now deprecated in favor of
  ``--format=just-symbols`` and ``-j``.
  (`D105330 <https://reviews.llvm.org/D105330>`_)

* In lli the default JIT engine switched from MCJIT (``-jit-kind=mcjit``) to ORC (``-jit-kind=orc``).
  (`D98931 <https://reviews.llvm.org/D98931>`_)
