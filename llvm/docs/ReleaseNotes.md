Introduction
============

This document contains the release notes for the LLVM Compiler Infrastructure,
release {{env.config.release}}.  Here we describe the status of LLVM, including
major improvements from the previous release, improvements in various subprojects
of LLVM, and some of the current users of the code.  All LLVM releases may be
downloaded from the [LLVM releases web site](https://llvm.org/releases/).

For more information about LLVM, including information about the latest
release, please check out the [main LLVM web site](https://llvm.org/).  If you
have questions or comments, the [Discourse forums](https://discourse.llvm.org)
is a good place to ask them.

Note that if you are reading this file from a Git checkout or the main
LLVM web page, this document applies to the *next* release, not the current
one.  To see the release notes for a specific release, please see the
[releases page](https://llvm.org/releases/).

Non-comprehensive list of changes in this release
=================================================

<!-- For small 1-3 sentence descriptions, just add an entry at the end of
this list. If your description won't fit comfortably in one bullet
point (e.g. maybe you would like to give an example of the
functionality, or simply have a lot to talk about), see the comment below
for adding a new subsection. -->

Changes to the LLVM IR
----------------------

* The `x86_mmx` IR type has been removed. It will be translated to
  the standard vector type `<1 x i64>` in bitcode upgrade.
* Renamed `llvm.experimental.stepvector` intrinsic to `llvm.stepvector`.

* Added `usub_cond` and `usub_sat` operations to `atomicrmw`.

* Introduced `noalias.addrspace` metadata.

* Remove the following intrinsics which can be replaced with a `bitcast`:

  * `llvm.nvvm.bitcast.f2i`
  * `llvm.nvvm.bitcast.i2f`
  * `llvm.nvvm.bitcast.d2ll`
  * `llvm.nvvm.bitcast.ll2d`

* Remove the following intrinsics which can be replaced with a funnel-shift:

  * `llvm.nvvm.rotate.b32`
  * `llvm.nvvm.rotate.right.b64`
  * `llvm.nvvm.rotate.b64`

* Remove the following intrinsics which can be replaced with an
  `addrspacecast`:

  * `llvm.nvvm.ptr.gen.to.global`
  * `llvm.nvvm.ptr.gen.to.shared`
  * `llvm.nvvm.ptr.gen.to.constant`
  * `llvm.nvvm.ptr.gen.to.local`
  * `llvm.nvvm.ptr.global.to.gen`
  * `llvm.nvvm.ptr.shared.to.gen`
  * `llvm.nvvm.ptr.constant.to.gen`
  * `llvm.nvvm.ptr.local.to.gen`

Changes to LLVM infrastructure
------------------------------

Changes to building LLVM
------------------------

Changes to TableGen
-------------------

Changes to Interprocedural Optimizations
----------------------------------------

Changes to the AArch64 Backend
------------------------------

* `.balign N, 0`, `.p2align N, 0`, `.align N, 0` in code sections will now fill
  the required alignment space with a sequence of `0x0` bytes (the requested
  fill value) rather than NOPs.

Changes to the AMDGPU Backend
-----------------------------

* Removed `llvm.amdgcn.flat.atomic.fadd` and
  `llvm.amdgcn.global.atomic.fadd` intrinsics. Users should use the
  {ref}`atomicrmw <i_atomicrmw>` instruction with `fadd` and
  addrspace(0) or addrspace(1) instead.

Changes to the ARM Backend
--------------------------

* `.balign N, 0`, `.p2align N, 0`, `.align N, 0` in code sections will now fill
  the required alignment space with a sequence of `0x0` bytes (the requested
  fill value) rather than NOPs.

Changes to the AVR Backend
--------------------------

Changes to the DirectX Backend
------------------------------

Changes to the Hexagon Backend
------------------------------

Changes to the LoongArch Backend
--------------------------------

Changes to the MIPS Backend
---------------------------

Changes to the PowerPC Backend
------------------------------

Changes to the RISC-V Backend
-----------------------------

* `.balign N, 0`, `.p2align N, 0`, `.align N, 0` in code sections will now fill
  the required alignment space with a sequence of `0x0` bytes (the requested
  fill value) rather than NOPs.
* Added Syntacore SCR4 and SCR5 CPUs: `-mcpu=syntacore-scr4/5-rv32/64`
* `-mcpu=sifive-p470` was added.
* Added Hazard3 CPU as taped out for RP2350: `-mcpu=rp2350-hazard3` (32-bit
  only).
* Fixed length vector support using RVV instructions now requires VLEN>=64. This
  means Zve32x and Zve32f will also require Zvl64b. The prior support was
  largely untested.
* The `Zvbc32e` and `Zvkgs` extensions are now supported experimentally.
* Added `Smctr` and `Ssctr` extensions.
* `-mcpu=syntacore-scr7` was added.
* The `Zacas` extension is no longer marked as experimental.

Changes to the WebAssembly Backend
----------------------------------

Changes to the Windows Target
-----------------------------

Changes to the X86 Backend
--------------------------

* `.balign N, 0x90`, `.p2align N, 0x90`, and `.align N, 0x90` in code sections
  now fill the required alignment space with repeating `0x90` bytes, rather than
  using optimised NOP filling. Optimised NOP filling fills the space with NOP
  instructions of various widths, not just those that use the `0x90` byte
  encoding. To use optimised NOP filling in a code section, leave off the
  "fillval" argument, i.e. `.balign N`, `.p2align N` or `.align N` respectively.

* Due to the removal of the `x86_mmx` IR type, functions with
  `x86_mmx` arguments or return values will use a different,
  incompatible, calling convention ABI. Such functions are not
  generally seen in the wild (Clang never generates them!), so this is
  not expected to result in real-world compatibility problems.

* Support ISA of `AVX10.2-256` and `AVX10.2-512`.

Changes to the OCaml bindings
-----------------------------

Changes to the Python bindings
------------------------------

Changes to the C API
--------------------

* The following symbols are deleted due to the removal of the `x86_mmx` IR type:

  * `LLVMX86_MMXTypeKind`
  * `LLVMX86MMXTypeInContext`
  * `LLVMX86MMXType`

 * The following functions are added to further support non-null-terminated strings:

  * `LLVMGetNamedFunctionWithLength`
  * `LLVMGetNamedGlobalWithLength`

* The following functions are added to access the `LLVMContextRef` associated
   with `LLVMValueRef` and `LLVMBuilderRef` objects:

  * `LLVMGetValueContext`
  * `LLVMGetBuilderContext`

* The new pass manager can now be invoked with a custom alias analysis pipeline, using
  the `LLVMPassBuilderOptionsSetAAPipeline` function.

* It is now also possible to run the new pass manager on a single function, by calling
  `LLVMRunPassesOnFunction` instead of `LLVMRunPasses`.

* Support for creating instructions with custom synchronization scopes has been added:

  * `LLVMGetSyncScopeID` to map a synchronization scope name to an ID.
  * `LLVMBuildFenceSyncScope`, `LLVMBuildAtomicRMWSyncScope` and
    `LLVMBuildAtomicCmpXchgSyncScope` versions of the existing builder functions
    with an additional synchronization scope ID parameter.
  * `LLVMGetAtomicSyncScopeID` and `LLVMSetAtomicSyncScopeID` to get and set the
    synchronization scope of any atomic instruction.
  * `LLVMIsAtomic` to check if an instruction is atomic, for use with the above functions.
    Because of backwards compatibility, `LLVMIsAtomicSingleThread` and
    `LLVMSetAtomicSingleThread` continue to work with any instruction type.

* The `LLVMSetPersonalityFn` and `LLVMSetInitializer` APIs now support clearing the
  personality function and initializer respectively by passing a null pointer.

* The following functions are added to allow iterating over debug records attached to
  instructions:

  * `LLVMGetFirstDbgRecord`
  * `LLVMGetLastDbgRecord`
  * `LLVMGetNextDbgRecord`
  * `LLVMGetPreviousDbgRecord`

* Added `LLVMAtomicRMWBinOpUSubCond` and `LLVMAtomicRMWBinOpUSubSat` to `LLVMAtomicRMWBinOp` enum for AtomicRMW instructions.
