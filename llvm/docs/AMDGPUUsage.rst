.. _amdgpu-target-features:

Target Features
---------------

Target features control how code is generated to support certain
processor specific features. Not all target features are supported by
all processors. The runtime must ensure that the features supported by
the device used to execute the code match the features enabled when
generating the code. A mismatch of features may result in incorrect
execution, or a reduction in performance.

The target features supported by each processor, and the default value
used if not specified explicitly, is listed in
:ref:`amdgpu-processor-table`.

Use the ``clang -m[no-]<TargetFeature>`` option to specify the AMDGPU
target features.

For example:

``-mxnack``
  Enable the ``xnack`` feature.
``-mno-xnack``
  Disable the ``xnack`` feature.

                            This is used for demand paging and page

                            the device, then if a page fault occurs
                            the code may execute incorrectly if the
                            ``xnack`` feature is not enabled. Executing
                            code that has the feature enabled on a
                            device that does not have XNACK replay
                            enabled will execute correctly, but may
                            be less performant than code with the

Address Spaces
--------------

The AMDGPU architecture supports a number of memory address spaces. The address
space names use the OpenCL standard names, with some additions.

The AMDGPU address spaces correspond to architecture-specific LLVM address
space numbers used in LLVM IR.

The AMDGPU address spaces are described in
:ref:`amdgpu-address-spaces-table`. Only 64-bit process address spaces are
supported for the ``amdgcn`` target.

     ================================= =============== =========== ================ ======= ============================

**Generic**
  The generic address space uses the hardware flat address support available in
  GFX7-GFX10. This uses two fixed ranges of virtual addresses (the private and
  local apertures), that are outside the range of addressable global memory, to
  map from a flat address to a private or local address.

  FLAT instructions can take a flat address and access global, private
  (scratch), and group (LDS) memory depending on if the address is within one
  of the aperture ranges. Flat access to scratch requires hardware aperture
  setup and setup in the kernel prologue (see
  :ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-flat-scratch`). Flat access to LDS requires hardware
  aperture setup and M0 (GFX7-GFX8) register setup (see
  :ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-m0`).

  To convert between a private or group address space address (termed a segment
  address) and a flat address the base address of the corresponding aperture
  can be used. For GFX7-GFX8 these are available in the
  :ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-hsa-aql-queue` the address of which can be obtained with
  Queue Ptr SGPR (see :ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-initial-kernel-execution-state`). For
  GFX9-GFX10 the aperture base addresses are directly available as inline
  constant registers ``SRC_SHARED_BASE/LIMIT`` and ``SRC_PRIVATE_BASE/LIMIT``.
  In 64-bit address mode the aperture sizes are 2^32 bytes and the base is
  aligned to 2^32 which makes it easier to convert from flat to segment or
  segment to flat.

  A global address space address has the same value when used as a flat address
  so no conversion is needed.

**Global and Constant**
  The global and constant address spaces both use global virtual addresses,
  which are the same virtual address space used by the CPU. However, some
  virtual addresses may only be accessible to the CPU, some only accessible
  by the GPU, and some by both.

  Using the constant address space indicates that the data will not change
  during the execution of the kernel. This allows scalar read instructions to
  be used. The vector and scalar L1 caches are invalidated of volatile data
  before each kernel dispatch execution to allow constant memory to change
  values between kernel dispatches.

**Region**
  The region address space uses the hardware Global Data Store (GDS). All
  wavefronts executing on the same device will access the same memory for any
  given region address. However, the same region address accessed by wavefronts
  executing on different devices will access different memory. It is higher
  performance than global memory. It is allocated by the runtime. The data
  store (DS) instructions can be used to access it.

**Local**
  The local address space uses the hardware Local Data Store (LDS) which is
  automatically allocated when the hardware creates the wavefronts of a
  work-group, and freed when all the wavefronts of a work-group have
  terminated. All wavefronts belonging to the same work-group will access the
  same memory for any given local address. However, the same local address
  accessed by wavefronts belonging to different work-groups will access
  different memory. It is higher performance than global memory. The data store
  (DS) instructions can be used to access it.

**Private**
  The private address space uses the hardware scratch memory support which
  automatically allocates memory when it creates a wavefront, and frees it when
  a wavefronts terminates. The memory accessed by a lane of a wavefront for any
  given private address will be different to the memory accessed by another lane
  of the same or different wavefront for the same private address.

  If a kernel dispatch uses scratch, then the hardware allocates memory from a
  pool of backing memory allocated by the runtime for each wavefront. The lanes
  of the wavefront access this using dword (4 byte) interleaving. The mapping
  used from private address to backing memory address is:

    ``wavefront-scratch-base +
    ((private-address / 4) * wavefront-size * 4) +
    (wavefront-lane-id * 4) + (private-address % 4)``

  If each lane of a wavefront accesses the same private address, the
  interleaving results in adjacent dwords being accessed and hence requires
  fewer cache lines to be fetched.

  There are different ways that the wavefront scratch base address is
  determined by a wavefront (see
  :ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-initial-kernel-execution-state`).

  Scratch memory can be accessed in an interleaved manner using buffer
  instructions with the scratch buffer descriptor and per wavefront scratch
  offset, by the scratch instructions, or by flat instructions. Multi-dword
  access is not supported except by flat and scratch instructions in
  GFX9-GFX10.

**Constant 32-bit**
  *TODO*

**Buffer Fat Pointer**
  The buffer fat pointer is an experimental address space that is currently
  unsupported in the backend. It exposes a non-integral pointer that is in
  the future intended to support the modelling of 128-bit buffer descriptors
  plus a 32-bit offset into the buffer (in total encapsulating a 160-bit
  *pointer*), allowing normal LLVM load/store/atomic operations to be used to
  model the buffer descriptors used heavily in graphics workloads targeting
  the backend.

.. _amdgpu-memory-scopes:

Memory Scopes
-------------

This section provides LLVM memory synchronization scopes supported by the AMDGPU
backend memory model when the target triple OS is ``amdhsa`` (see
:ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-memory-model` and :ref:`amdgpu-target-triples`).

The memory model supported is based on the HSA memory model [HSA]_ which is
based in turn on HRF-indirect with scope inclusion [HRF]_. The happens-before
relation is transitive over the synchronizes-with relation independent of scope,
and synchronizes-with allows the memory scope instances to be inclusive (see
table :ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-llvm-sync-scopes-table`).

This is different to the OpenCL [OpenCL]_ memory model which does not have scope
inclusion and requires the memory scopes to exactly match. However, this
is conservatively correct for OpenCL.

Code Object
===========

The AMDGPU backend generates a standard ELF [ELF]_ relocatable code object that
can be linked by ``lld`` to produce a standard ELF shared code object which can
be loaded and executed on an AMDGPU target.

Header
------

The AMDGPU backend uses the following ELF header:

  .. table:: AMDGPU ELF Header

     =============================== =====

``e_ident[EI_CLASS]``
  The ELF class is:

  * ``ELFCLASS32`` for ``r600`` architecture.

  * ``ELFCLASS64`` for ``amdgcn`` architecture which only supports 64-bit
    process address space applications.

``e_ident[EI_DATA]``
  All AMDGPU targets use ``ELFDATA2LSB`` for little-endian byte ordering.

``e_ident[EI_OSABI]``
  One of the following AMDGPU architecture specific OS ABIs
  (see :ref:`amdgpu-os-table`):

  * ``ELFOSABI_NONE`` for *unknown* OS.

  * ``ELFOSABI_AMDGPU_HSA`` for ``amdhsa`` OS.

  * ``ELFOSABI_AMDGPU_PAL`` for ``amdpal`` OS.

  * ``ELFOSABI_AMDGPU_MESA3D`` for ``mesa3D`` OS.

``e_ident[EI_ABIVERSION]``
  The ABI version of the AMDGPU architecture specific OS ABI to which the code
  object conforms:

  * ``ELFABIVERSION_AMDGPU_HSA`` is used to specify the version of AMD HSA
    runtime ABI.

  * ``ELFABIVERSION_AMDGPU_PAL`` is used to specify the version of AMD PAL
    runtime ABI.

  * ``ELFABIVERSION_AMDGPU_MESA3D`` is used to specify the version of AMD MESA
    3D runtime ABI.

``e_type``
  Can be one of the following values:


  ``ET_REL``
    The type produced by the AMDGPU backend compiler as it is relocatable code
    object.

  ``ET_DYN``
    The type produced by the linker as it is a shared code object.

  The AMD HSA runtime loader requires a ``ET_DYN`` code object.

``e_machine``
  The value ``EM_AMDGPU`` is used for the machine for all processors supported
  by the ``r600`` and ``amdgcn`` architectures (see
  :ref:`amdgpu-processor-table`). The specific processor is specified in the
  ``EF_AMDGPU_MACH`` bit field of the ``e_flags`` (see
  :ref:`amdgpu-elf-header-e_flags-table`).

``e_entry``
  The entry point is 0 as the entry points for individual kernels must be
  selected in order to invoke them through AQL packets.

``e_flags``
  The AMDGPU backend uses the following ELF header flags:

  .. table:: AMDGPU ELF Header ``e_flags``

Note Records
------------

The AMDGPU backend code object contains ELF note records in the ``.note``
section. The set of generated notes and their semantics depend on the code
object version; see :ref:`amdgpu-note-records-v2` and
:ref:`amdgpu-note-records-v3`.

As required by ``ELFCLASS32`` and ``ELFCLASS64``, minimal zero byte padding
must be generated after the ``name`` field to ensure the ``desc`` field is 4
byte aligned. In addition, minimal zero byte padding must be generated to
ensure the ``desc`` field size is a multiple of 4 bytes. The ``sh_addralign``
field of the ``.note`` section must be at least 4 to indicate at least 8 byte
alignment.

  will resolve relocations using the definition provided by another code object
  or explicitly defined by the runtime.

  If the symbol resides in local/group memory (LDS) then its section is the
  special processor-specific section name ``SHN_AMDGPU_LDS``, and the
  ``st_value`` field describes alignment requirements as it does for common
  symbols.

     are marked as STT_NOTYPE.

Kernel descriptor
  Every HSA kernel has an associated kernel descriptor. It is the address of the
  kernel descriptor that is used in the AQL dispatch packet used to invoke the
  kernel, not the kernel entry point. The layout of the HSA kernel descriptor is
  defined in :ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-kernel-descriptor`.

Kernel entry point
  Every HSA kernel also has a symbol for its machine code entry point.

.. _amdgpu-relocation-records:

Relocation Records
------------------

AMDGPU backend generates ``Elf64_Rela`` relocation records. Supported
relocatable fields are:

``word32``
  This specifies a 32-bit field occupying 4 bytes with arbitrary byte
  alignment. These values use the same byte order as other word values in the
  AMDGPU architecture.

``word64``
  This specifies a 64-bit field occupying 8 bytes with arbitrary byte
  alignment. These values use the same byte order as other word values in the
  AMDGPU architecture.

Following notations are used for specifying relocation calculations:

**A**
  Represents the addend used to compute the value of the relocatable field.

**G**
  Represents the offset into the global offset table at which the relocation
  entry's symbol will reside during execution.

**GOT**
  Represents the address of the global offset table.

**P**
  Represents the place (section offset for ``et_rel`` or address for ``et_dyn``)
  of the storage unit being relocated (computed using ``r_offset``).

**S**
  Represents the value of the symbol whose index resides in the relocation
  entry. Relocations not using this must specify a symbol index of
  ``STN_UNDEF``.

**B**
  Represents the base address of a loaded executable or shared object which is
  the difference between the ELF address and the actual load address.
  Relocations using this are only valid in executable or shared objects.

The following relocation types are supported:

DWARF
-----

.. warning::
   This section describes a **provisional proposal** that is not currently
   fully implemented and is subject to change.

Standard DWARF [DWARF]_ sections can be generated. These contain information
that maps the code object executable code and data to the source language
constructs. It can be used by tools such as debuggers and profilers.

This section defines the AMDGPU target specific DWARF. It applies to DWARF
Version 4 and 5.

.. _amdgpu-dwarf-overview:

Overview
~~~~~~~~

The AMDGPU has several features that require additional DWARF functionality in
order to support optimized code.

A single code object can contain code for kernels that have different wave
sizes. The vector registers and some scalar registers are based on the wave
size. AMDGPU defines distinct DWARF registers for each wave size. This
simplifies the consumer of the DWARF so that each register has a fixed size,
rather than being dynamic according to the wave mode. Similarly, distinct DWARF
registers are defined for those registers that vary in size according to the
process address size. This allows a consumer to treat a specific AMDGPU target
as a single architecture regardless of how it is configured. The compiler
explicitly specifies the registers that match the mode of the code it is
generating.

AMDGPU optimized code may spill vector registers to non-global address space
memory, and this spilling may be done only for lanes that are active on entry to
the subprogram. To support this, a location description that can be created as a
masked select is required.

Since the active lane mask may be held in a register, a way to get the value of
a register on entry to a subprogram is required. To support this an operation
that returns the caller value of a register as specified by the Call Frame
Information (see :ref:`amdgpu-call-frame-information`) is required.

Current DWARF uses an empty expression to indicate an undefined location
description. Since the masked select composite location description operation
takes more than one location description, it is necessary to have an explicit
way to specify an undefined location description. Otherwise it is not possible
to specify that a particular one of the input location descriptions is
undefined.

CFI describes restoring callee saved registers that are spilled. Currently CFI
only allows a location description that is a register, memory address, or
implicit location description. AMDGPU optimized code may spill scalar registers
into portions of vector registers. This requires extending CFI to allow any
location description.

The vector registers of the AMDGPU are represented as their full wave size,
meaning the wave size times the dword size. This reflects the actual hardware,
and allows the compiler to generate DWARF for languages that map a thread to the
complete wave. It also allows more efficient DWARF to be generated to describe
the CFI as only a single expression is required for the whole vector register,
rather than a separate expression for each lane's dword of the vector register.
It also allows the compiler to produce DWARF that indexes the vector register if
it spills scalar registers into portions of a vector registers.

Since DWARF stack value entries have a base type and AMDGPU registers are a
vector of dwords, the ability to specify that a base type is a vector is
required.

If the source language is mapped onto the AMDGPU wavefronts in a SIMT manner,
then the variable DWARF location expressions must compute the location for a
single lane of the wavefront. Therefore, a DWARF operator is required to denote
the current lane, much like ``DW_OP_push_object_address`` denotes the current
object. The ``DW_OP_*piece`` operators only allow literal indices. Therefore, a
composite location description is required that can take a computed index of a
location description (such as a vector register).

If the source language is mapped onto the AMDGPU wavefronts in a SIMT manner the
compiler can use the AMDGPU execution mask register to control which lanes are
active. To describe the conceptual location of non-active lanes a DWARF
expression is needed that can compute a per lane PC. For efficiency, this is
done for the wave as a whole. This expression benefits by having a masked select
composite location description operation. This requires an attribute for source
location of each lane. The AMDGPU may update the execution mask for whole wave
operations and so needs an attribute that computes the current active lane mask.

AMDGPU needs to be able to describe addresses that are in different kinds of
memory. Optimized code may need to describe a variable that resides in pieces
that are in different kinds of storage which may include parts of registers,
memory that is in a mixture of memory kinds, implicit values, or be undefined.
DWARF has the concept of segment addresses. However, the segment cannot be
specified within a DWARF expression, which is only able to specify the offset
portion of a segment address. The segment index is only provided by the entity
that species the DWARF expression. Therefore, the segment index is a property
that can only be put on complete objects, such as a variable. That makes it only
suitable for describing an entity (such as variable or subprogram code) that is
in a single kind of memory. Therefore, AMDGPU uses the DWARF concept of address
spaces. For example, a variable may be allocated in a register that is partially
spilled to the call stack which is in the private address space, and partially
spilled to the local address space.

DWARF uses the concept of an address in many expression operators but does not
define how it relates to address spaces. For example,
``DW_OP_push_object_address`` pushes the address of an object. Other contexts
implicitly push an address on the stack before evaluating an expression. For
example, the ``DW_AT_use_location`` attribute of the
``DW_TAG_ptr_to_member_type``. The expression that uses the address needs to do
so in a general way and not need to be dependent on the address space of the
address. For example, a pointer to member value may want to be applied to an
object that may reside in any address space.

The number of registers and the cost of memory operations is much higher for
AMDGPU than a typical CPU. The compiler attempts to optimize whole variables and
arrays into registers. Currently DWARF only allows ``DW_OP_push_object_address``
and related operations to work with a global memory location. To support AMDGPU
optimized code it is required to generalize DWARF to allow any location
description to be used. This allows registers, or composite location
descriptions that may be a mixture of memory, registers, or even implicit
values.

Allowing a location description to be an entry on the DWARF stack allows them to
compose naturally. It allows objects to be located in any kind of memory address
space, in registers, be implicit values, be undefined, or a composite of any of
these.

By extending DWARF carefully, all existing DWARF expressions can retain their
current semantic meaning. DWARF has implicit conversions that convert from a
value that is treated as an address in the default address space to a memory
location description. This can be extended to allow a default address space
memory location description to be implicitly converted back to its address
value. To allow composition of composite location descriptions, an explicit
operator that indicates the end is required. This can be implied if the end of a
DWARF expression is reached, allowing current DWARF expressions to remain legal.

The ``DW_OP_plus`` and ``DW_OP_minus`` can be defined to operate on a memory
location description in the default target architecture address space and a
generic type, and produce a memory location description. This allows them to
continue to be used to offset an address. To generalize offsetting to any
location description, including location descriptions that describe when bytes
are in registers, are implicit, or a composite of these, the
``DW_OP_LLVM_offset`` and ``DW_OP_LLVM_bit_offset`` operations are added. These
do not perform wrapping which would be hard to define for location descriptions
of non-memory kinds. This allows ``DW_OP_push_object_address`` to push a
location description that may be in a register, or be an implicit value, and the
DWARF expression of ``DW_TAG_ptr_to_member_type`` can contain
``DW_OP_LLVM_offset`` to offset within it. ``DW_OP_LLVM_bit_offset`` generalizes
DWARF to work with bit fields.

The DWARF ``DW_OP_xderef*`` operation allows a value to be converted into an
address of a specified address space which is then read. But provides no way to
create a memory location description for an address in the non-default address
space. For example, AMDGPU variables can be allocated in the local address space
at a fixed address. It is required to have an operation to create an address in
a specific address space that can be used to define the location description of
the variable. Defining this operation to produce a location description allows
the size of addresses in an address space to be larger than the generic type.

If an operation had to produce a value that can be implicitly converted to a
memory location description, then it would be limited to the size of the generic
type which matches the size of the default address space. Its value would be
unspecified and likely not match any value in the actual program. By making the
result a location description, it allows a consumer great freedom in how it
implements it. The implicit conversion back to a value can be limited only to
the default address space to maintain compatibility.

Similarly ``DW_OP_breg*`` treats the register as containing an address in the
default address space. It is required to be able to specify the address space of
the register value.

Almost all uses of addresses in DWARF are limited to defining location
descriptions, or to be dereferenced to read memory. The exception is
``DW_CFA_val_offset`` which uses the address to set the value of a register. By
defining the CFA DWARF expression as being a memory location description, it can
maintain what address space it is, and that can be used to convert the offset
address back to an address in that address space. (An alternative is to defined
``DW_CFA_val_offset`` to implicitly use the default address space, and add
another operation that specifies the address space.)

This approach allows all existing DWARF to have the identical semantics. It
allows the compiler to explicitly specify the address space it is using. For
example, a compiler could choose to access private memory in a swizzled manner
when mapping a source language to a wave in a SIMT manner, or to access it in an
unswizzled manner if mapping the same language with the wave being the thread.
It also allows the compiler to mix the address space it uses to access private
memory. For example, for SIMT it can still spill entire vector registers in an
unswizzled manner, while using swizzled for SIMT variable access. This approach
allows memory location descriptions for different address spaces to be combined
using the regular ``DW_OP_*piece`` operators.

Location descriptions are an abstraction of storage, they give freedom to the
consumer on how to implement them. They allow the address space to encode lane
information so they can be used to read memory with only the memory description
and no extra arguments. The same set of operations can operate on locations
independent of their kind of storage. The ``DW_OP_deref*`` therefore can be used
on any storage kind. ``DW_OP_xderef*`` is unnecessary except to become a more
compact way to convert a segment address followed by dereferencing it.

Several approaches were considered, and the one proposed appears to be the
cleanest and offers the greatest improvement of DWARF's ability to support
optimized code. Examining the gdb debugger and LLVM compiler, it appears only to
require modest changes as they both already have to support general use of
location descriptions. It is anticipated that will be the case for other
debuggers and compilers.

The following provides the definitions for the additional operators, as well as
clarifying how existing expression operators, CFI operators, and attributes
behave with respect to generalized location descriptions that support address
spaces. It has been defined such that it is backwards compatible with DWARF 5.
The definitions are intended to fully define well-formed DWARF in a consistent
style. Some sections are organized to mirror the DWARF 5 specification
structure, with non-normative text shown in *italics*.

   ============== ================= ======== ==================================

The vector registers are represented as the full size for the wavefront. They
are organized as consecutive dwords (32-bits), one per lane, with the dword at
the least significant bit position corresponding to lane 0 and so forth. DWARF
location expressions involving the ``DW_OP_LLVM_offset`` and
``DW_OP_LLVM_push_lane`` operations are used to select the part of the vector
register corresponding to the lane that is executing the current thread of
execution in languages that are implemented using a SIMD or SIMT execution
model.

If the wavefront size is 32 lanes then the wave 32 mode register definitions
are used. If the wavefront size is 64 lanes then the wave 64 mode register
definitions are used. Some AMDGPU targets support executing in both wave 32
and wave 64 mode. The register definitions corresponding to the wave mode
of the generated code will be used.

If code is generated to execute in a 32-bit process address space then the
32-bit process address space register definitions are used. If code is
generated to execute in a 64-bit process address space then the 64-bit process
address space register definitions are used. The ``amdgcn`` target only
supports the 64-bit process address space.

Address Class Mapping
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

DWARF address classes are used for languages with the concept of memory address
spaces. They are used in the ``DW_AT_address_class`` attribute for pointer type,
reference type, subroutine, and subroutine type debugger information entries
(DIEs).

The address class mapping for AMDGPU is defined in
:ref:`amdgpu-dwarf-address-class-mapping-table`.

.. table:: AMDGPU DWARF Address Class Mapping
   :name: amdgpu-dwarf-address-class-mapping-table

   =========================== ===== =================

See :ref:`amdgpu-address-spaces` for information on the AMDGPU address spaces
including address size and NULL value.

For AMDGPU the address class encodes the address class as declared in the
source language type.

For AMDGPU if no ``DW_AT_address_class`` attribute is present, then the
``DW_ADDR_none`` address class is used.

.. note::

  The ``DW_ADDR_none`` default was defined as ``Generic`` and not ``Global``
  to match the LLVM address space ordering. This ordering was chosen to better
  support CUDA-like languages such as HIP that do not have address spaces in
  the language type system, but do allow variables to be allocated in
  different address spaces. So effectively all CUDA and HIP source language
  addresses are generic.

.. note::

  Currently DWARF defines address class values as architecture specific. It
  is unclear how language specific address spaces are intended to be
  represented in DWARF.

  For example, OpenCL defines address spaces for ``global``, ``local``,
  ``constant``, and ``private``. These are part of the type system and are
  modifies to pointer types. In addition, OpenCL defines ``generic`` pointers
  that can reference either the ``global``, ``local``, or ``private`` address
  spaces. To support the OpenCL language the debugger would want to support
  casting pointers between the ``generic`` and other address spaces, and
  possibly using pointer casting to form an address for a specific address
  space out of an integral value.

  The method to use to dereference a pointer type or reference type value is
  defined in DWARF expressions using ``DW_OP_xderef*`` which uses an
  architecture specific address space.

  DWARF defines the ``DW_AT_address_class`` attribute on pointer types and
  reference types. It specifies the method to use to dereference them. Why
  is the value of this not the same as the address space value used in
  ``DW_OP_xderef*`` since in both cases it is architecture specific and the
  architecture presumably will use the same set of methods to dereference
  pointers in both cases?

  Since ``DW_AT_address_class`` uses an architecture specific value it cannot
  in general capture the source language address space type modifier concept.
  On some architectures all source language address space modifies may
  actually use the same method for dereferencing pointers.

  One possibility is for DWARF to add an ``DW_TAG_LLVM_address_class_type``
  type modifier that can be applied to a pointer type and reference type. The
  ``DW_AT_address_class`` attribute could be re-defined to not be architecture
  specific and instead define generalized language values that will support
  OpenCL and other languages using address spaces. The ``DW_AT_address_class``
  could be defined to not be applied to pointer or reference types, but
  instead only to the ``DW_TAG_LLVM_address_class_type`` type modifier entry.

  If a pointer type or reference type is not modified by
  ``DW_TAG_LLVM_address_class_type`` or if ``DW_TAG_LLVM_address_class_type``
  has no ``DW_AT_address_class`` attribute, then the pointer type or reference
  type would be defined to use the ``DW_ADDR_none`` address class as
  currently. Since modifiers can be chained, it would need to be defined if
  multiple ``DW_TAG_LLVM_address_class_type`` modifies was legal, and if so if
  the outermost one is the one that takes precedence.

  A target implementation that supports multiple address spaces would need to
  map ``DW_ADDR_none`` appropriately to support CUDA-like languages
  that have no address classes in the type system, but do support variable
  allocation in address spaces. See the above note that describes why AMDGPU
  choose to make ``DW_ADDR_none`` map to the ``Generic`` AMDGPU address space
  and not the ``Global`` address space.

  An alternative would be to define ``DW_ADDR_none`` as being the global
  address class and then change ``DW_ADDR_global`` to ``DW_ADDR_generic``.
  Compilers generating DWARF for CUDA-like languages would then have to define
  every CUDA-like language pointer type or reference type using
  ``DW_TAG_LLVM_address_class_type`` with a ``DW_AT_address_class`` attribute
  of ``DW_ADDR_generic`` to match the language semantics. The AMDGPU
  alternative avoids needing to do this and seems to fit better into how CLANG
  and LLVM have added support for the CUDA-like languages on top of existing
  C++ language support.

  A new ``DW_AT_address_space`` attribute could be defined that can be applied
  to pointer type, reference type, subroutine, and subroutine type to describe
  how objects having the given type are dereferenced or called (the role that
  ``DW_AT_address_class`` currently provides). The values of
  ``DW_AT_address_space`` would be architecture specific and the same as used
  in ``DW_OP_xderef*``.

Address Space Mapping

DWARF address spaces are used in location expressions to describe the memory
space where data resides. Address spaces correspond to a target specific memory

See :ref:`amdgpu-address-spaces` for information on the AMDGPU address spaces
including address size and NULL value.

The ``DW_ASPACE_none`` address space is the default address space used in DWARF
operations that do not specify an address space. It therefore has to map to the
global address space so that the ``DW_OP_addr*`` and related operations can
refer to addresses in the program code.

The ``DW_ASPACE_AMDGPU_generic`` address space allows location expressions to
specify the flat address space. If the address corresponds to an address in the
local address space then it corresponds to the wave that is executing the
focused thread of execution. If the address corresponds to an address in the
private address space then it corresponds to the lane that is executing the
focused thread of execution for languages that are implemented using a SIMD or
SIMT execution model.

.. note::

  CUDA-like languages such as HIP that do not have address spaces in the
  language type system, but do allow variables to be allocated in different
  address spaces, will need to explicitly specify the
  ``DW_ASPACE_AMDGPU_generic`` address space in the DWARF operations as the
  default address space is the global address space.

The ``DW_ASPACE_AMDGPU_local`` address space allows location expressions to
specify the local address space corresponding to the wave that is executing the
focused thread of execution.

The ``DW_ASPACE_AMDGPU_private_lane`` address space allows location expressions
to specify the private address space corresponding to the lane that is
executing the focused thread of execution for languages that are implemented
using a SIMD or SIMT execution model.

The ``DW_ASPACE_AMDGPU_private_wave`` address space allows location expressions
to specify the unswizzled private address space corresponding to the wave that
is executing the focused thread of execution. The wave view of private memory
is the per wave unswizzled backing memory layout defined in
:ref:`amdgpu-address-spaces`, such that address 0 corresponds to the first
location for the backing memory of the wave (namely the address is not offset
by ``wavefront-scratch-base``). So to convert from a
``DW_ASPACE_AMDGPU_private_lane`` to a ``DW_ASPACE_AMDGPU_private_wave``
segment address perform the following:

::

  private-address-wave =
    ((private-address-lane / 4) * wavefront-size * 4) +
    (wavefront-lane-id * 4) + (private-address-lane % 4)

If the ``DW_ASPACE_AMDGPU_private_lane`` segment address is dword aligned and
the start of the dwords for each lane starting with lane 0 is required, then
this simplifies to:

::

  private-address-wave =
    private-address-lane * wavefront-size

A compiler can use this address space to read a complete spilled vector
register back into a complete vector register in the CFI. The frame pointer can
be a private lane segment address which is dword aligned, which can be shifted
to multiply by the wave size, and then used to form a private wave segment
address that gives a location for a contiguous set of dwords, one per lane,
where the vector register dwords are spilled. The compiler knows the wave size
since it generates the code. Note that the type of the address may have to be
converted as the size of a private lane segment address may be smaller than the
size of a private wave segment address.

The ``DW_ASPACE_AMDGPU_private_lane<n>`` address space allows location
expressions to specify the private address space corresponding to a specific
lane. For example, this can be used when the compiler spills scalar registers
to scratch memory, with each scalar register being saved to a different lane's
scratch memory.

.. _amdgpu-dwarf-expressions:

Expressions
~~~~~~~~~~~

The following sections define the new DWARF expression operator used by AMDGPU,
as well as clarifying the extensions to already existing DWARF 5 operations.

DWARF expressions describe how to compute a value or specify a location
description. An expression is encoded as a stream of operations, each consisting
of an opcode followed by zero or more literal operands. The number of operands
is implied by the opcode.

Operations represent a postfix operation on a simple stack machine. They can act
on entries on the stack, including adding entries and removing entries. If the
kind of a stack entry does not match the kind required by the operation, and is
not implicitly convertible to the required kind, then the DWARF expression is
ill-formed.

Each stack entry can be one of two kinds: a value or a location description.
Value stack entries are described in :ref:`amdgpu-value-operations` and
location description stack entries are described in
:ref:`amdgpu-location-description-operations`.

*The evaluation of a DWARF expression can provide the location description of an
object, the value of an array bound, the length of a dynamic string, the desired
value itself, and so on.*

The result of the evaluation of a DWARF expression is defined as:

* If evaluation of the DWARF expression is on behalf of a ``DW_OP_call*``
  operation for a ``DW_AT_location`` attribute that belongs to a
  ``DW_TAG_dwarf_procedure`` debugging information entry, then all the entries
  on the stack are left, and execution of the DWARF expression containing the
  ``DW_OP_call*`` operation continues.

* If evaluation of the DWARF expression requires a location description, then:

  * If the stack is empty, an undefined location description is returned.

  * If the top stack entry is a location description, or can be converted to
    one, then the, possibly converted, location description is returned. Any
    other entries on the stack are discarded.

  * Otherwise the DWARF expression is ill-formed.

    .. note::

      Could define this case as returning an implicit location description as
      if the ``DW_OP_implicit`` operation is performed.

* If evaluation of the DWARF expression requires a value, then:

  * If the top stack entry is a value, or can be converted to one, then the,
    possibly converted, value is returned. Any other entries on the stack are
    discarded.

  * Otherwise the DWARF expression is ill-formed.

.. _amdgpu-stack-operations:

Stack Operations
++++++++++++++++

The following operations manipulate the DWARF stack. Operations that index
the stack assume that the top of the stack (most recently added entry) has index
0. They allow the stack entries to be either a value or location description.

If any stack entry accessed by a stack operation is an incomplete composite
location description, then the DWARF expression is ill-formed.

.. note::

  These operations now support stack entries that are values and location
  descriptions.

.. note::

  If it is desired to also make them work with incomplete composite location
  descriptions then would need to define that the composite location storage
  specified by the incomplete composite location description is also replicated
  when a copy is pushed. This ensures that each copy of the incomplete composite
  location description can updated the composite location storage they specify
  independently.

1.  ``DW_OP_dup``

    ``DW_OP_dup`` duplicates the stack entry at the top of the stack.

2.  ``DW_OP_drop``

    ``DW_OP_drop`` pops the stack entry at the top of the stack and discards it.

3.  ``DW_OP_pick``

    ``DW_OP_pick`` has a single unsigned 1-byte operand that is treated as an
    index I. A copy of the stack entry with index I is pushed onto the stack.

4.  ``DW_OP_over``

    ``DW_OP_over`` pushes a copy of the entry entry with index 1.

    *This is equivalent to a ``DW_OP_pick 1`` operation.*

5.  ``DW_OP_swap``

    ``DW_OP_swap`` swaps the top two stack entries. The entry at the top of the
    stack becomes the second stack entry, and the second stack entry becomes the
    top of the stack.

6.  ``DW_OP_rot``

    ``DW_OP_rot`` rotates the first three stack entries. The entry at the top of
    the stack becomes the third stack entry, the second entry becomes the top of
    the stack, and the third entry becomes the second entry.

.. _amdgpu-value-operations:

Value Operations
++++++++++++++++

Each value stack entry has a type and a value, and can represent a value of
any supported base type of the target machine. The base type specifies the size
and encoding of the value.

.. note::

  It may be better to add an implicit pointer value kind that is produced when
  ``DW_OP_deref*`` retrieves the full contents of an implicit pointer location
  storage created by the ``DW_OP_implicit_pointer`` or
  ``DW_OP_LLVM_aspace_implicit_pointer`` operations.

Instead of a base type, value stack entries can have a distinguished generic
type, which is an integral type that has the size of an address in the target
architecture default address space on the target machine and unspecified
signedness.

*The generic type is the same as the unspecified type used for stack operations
defined in DWARF Version 4 and before.*

An integral type is a base type that has an encoding of ``DW_ATE_signed``,
``DW_ATE_signed_char``, ``DW_ATE_unsigned``, ``DW_ATE_unsigned_char``,
``DW_ATE_boolean``, or any target architecture defined integral encoding in the
inclusive range ``DW_ATE_lo_user`` to ``DW_ATE_hi_user``.

.. note::

  Unclear if ``DW_ATE_address`` is an integral type. gdb does not seem to
  consider as integral.

1.  ``DW_OP_LLVM_push_lane`` *New*

    ``DW_OP_LLVM_push_lane`` pushes a value with the generic type that is the
    target architecture lane identifier of the thread of execution for which a
    user presented expression is currently being evaluated. For languages that
    are implemented using a SIMD or SIMT execution model this is the lane number
    that corresponds to the source language thread of execution upon which the
    user is focused. Otherwise this is the value 0.

    For AMDGPU, the lane identifier returned by ``DW_OP_LLVM_push_lane``
    corresponds to the the hardware lane number which is numbered from 0 to the
    wavefront size minus 1.

2.  ``DW_OP_entry_value``

    ``DW_OP_entry_value`` pushes the value that the described location held upon
    entering the current subprogram.

    It has two operands. The first is an unsigned LEB128 integer. The second is
    a block of bytes, with a length equal to the first operand, treated as a
    DWARF expression E.

    E is evaluated as if it had been evaluated upon entering the current
    subprogram. E assumes no values are present on the DWARF stack initially and
    results in exactly one value being pushed on the DWARF stack when completed.

    ``DW_OP_push_object_address`` is not meaningful inside of this DWARF
    operation.

    If the result of E is a register location description (see
    :ref:`amdgpu-register-location-descriptions`), ``DW_OP_entry_value`` pushes
    the value that register had upon entering the current subprogram. The value
    entry type is the target machine register base type. If the register value
    is undefined or the register location description bit offset is not 0, then
    the DWARF expression is ill-formed.

    *The register location description provides a more compact form for the case
    where the value was in a register on entry to the subprogram.*

    Otherwise, the expression result is required to be a value, and
    ``DW_OP_entry_value`` pushes that value.

    *The values needed to evaluate* ``DW_OP_entry_value`` *could be obtained in
    several ways. The consumer could suspend execution on entry to the
    subprogram, record values needed by* ``DW_OP_entry_value`` *expressions
    within the subprogram, and then continue; when evaluating*
    ``DW_OP_entry_value``\ *, the consumer would use these recorded values
    rather than the current values. Or, when evaluating* ``DW_OP_entry_value``\
    *, the consumer could virtually unwind using the Call Frame Information
    (see* :ref:`amdgpu-call-frame-information`\ *) to recover register values
    that might have been clobbered since the subprogram entry point.*

    .. note::

      Unclear why this operation is defined this way. If the expression is
      simply using existing variables then it is just a regular expression. It
      is unclear how the compiler instructs the consumer how to create the saved
      copies of the variables on entry. Seems only the compiler knows how to do
      this. If the main purpose is only to read the entry value of a register
      using CFI then would be better to have an operation that explicitly does
      just that such as ``DW_OP_LLVM_call_frame_entry_reg``.

.. _amdgpu-location-description-operations:

Location Description Operations
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Information about the location of program objects is provided by location
descriptions. Location descriptions specify the storage that holds the program
objects, and a position within the storage.

A location storage is a linear stream of bits that can hold values. Each
location storage has a size in bits and can be accessed using a zero-based bit
offset. The ordering of bits within location storage uses the bit numbering and
direction conventions that are appropriate to the current language on the target
architecture.

.. note::

  For AMDGPU bytes are ordered with least significant bytes first, and bits are
  ordered within bytes with least significant bits first.

There are five kinds of location storage: undefined, memory, register, implicit,
and composite. Memory and register location storage corresponds to the target
architecture memory address spaces and registers. Implicit location storage
corresponds to fixed values that can only be read. Undefined location storage
indicates no value is available and therefore cannot be read or written.
Composite location storage allows a mixture of these where some bits come from
one kind of location storage and some from another kind of location storage.

.. note::

  It may be better to add an implicit pointer location storage kind for
  ``DW_OP_implicit_pointer`` or ``DW_OP_LLVM_aspace_implicit_pointer``.

Location description stack entries specify a location storage to which they
refer, and a bit offset relative to the start of the location storage.

General Operations
##################

1.  ``DW_OP_LLVM_offset`` *New*

    ``DW_OP_LLVM_offset`` pops two stack entries. The first must be an integral
    type value that is treated as a byte displacement D. The second must be a
    location description L.

    It adds the value of D scaled by 8 (the byte size) to the bit offset of L,
    and pushes the updated L.

    If the updated bit offset of L is less than 0 or greater than or equal to
    the size of the location storage specified by L, then the DWARF expression
    is ill-formed.

2.  ``DW_OP_LLVM_offset_uconst`` *New*

    ``DW_OP_LLVM_offset_uconst`` has a single unsigned LEB128 integer operand
    that is treated as a displacement D.

    It pops one stack entry that must be a location description L. It adds the
    value of D scaled by 8 (the byte size) to the bit offset of L, and pushes
    the updated L.

    If the updated bit offset of L is less than 0 or greater than or equal to
    the size of the location storage specified by L, then the DWARF expression
    is ill-formed.

    *This operation is supplied specifically to be able to encode more field
    displacements in two bytes than can be done with* ``DW_OP_lit<n>
    DW_OP_LLVM_offset``\ *.*

3.  ``DW_OP_LLVM_bit_offset`` *New*

    ``DW_OP_LLVM_bit_offset`` pops two stack entries. The first must be an
    integral type value that is treated as a bit displacement D. The second must
    be a location description L.

    It adds the value of D to the bit offset of L, and pushes the updated L.

    If the updated bit offset of L is less than 0 or greater than or equal to
    the size of the location storage specified by L, then the DWARF expression
    is ill-formed.

4.  ``DW_OP_deref``

    The ``DW_OP_deref`` operation pops one stack entry that must be a location
    description L.

    A value of the bit size of the generic type is retrieved from the location
    storage specified by L starting at the bit offset specified by L. The
    retrieved generic type value V is pushed on the stack.

    If any bit of the value is retrieved from the undefined location storage, or
    the offset of any bit exceeds the size of the location storage specified by
    L, then the DWARF expression is ill-formed.

    See :ref:`amdgpu-implicit-location-descriptions` for special rules
    concerning implicit location descriptions created by the
    ``DW_OP_implicit_pointer`` and ``DW_OP_LLVM_implicit_aspace_pointer``
    operations.

5.  ``DW_OP_deref_size``

    ``DW_OP_deref_size`` has a single 1-byte unsigned integral constant treated
    as a byte result size S.

    It pops one stack entry that must be a location description L.

    A value of S scaled by 8 (the byte size) bits is retrieved from the location
    storage specified by L starting at the bit offset specified by L. The value
    V retrieved is zero-extended to the bit size of the generic type before
    being pushed onto the stack with the generic type.

    If S is larger than the byte size of the generic type, if any bit of the
    value is retrieved from the undefined location storage, or if the offset of
    any bit exceeds the size of the location storage specified by L, then the
    DWARF expression is ill-formed.

    See :ref:`amdgpu-implicit-location-descriptions` for special rules
    concerning implicit location descriptions created by the
    ``DW_OP_implicit_pointer`` and ``DW_OP_LLVM_implicit_aspace_pointer``
    operations.

6.  ``DW_OP_deref_type``

    ``DW_OP_deref_type`` has two operands. The first is a 1-byte unsigned
    integral constant whose value S is the same as the size of the base type
    referenced by the second operand. The second operand is an unsigned LEB128
    integer that represents the offset of a debugging information entry E in the
    current compilation unit, which must be a ``DW_TAG_base_type`` entry that
    provides the type of the result value.

    It pops one stack entry that must be a location description L. A value of
    the bit size S is retrieved from the location storage specified by L
    starting at the bit offset specified by the L. The retrieved result type
    value V is pushed on the stack.

    If any bit of the value is retrieved from the undefined location storage, or
    if the offset of any bit exceeds the size of the specified location storage,
    then the DWARF expression is ill-formed.

    See :ref:`amdgpu-implicit-location-descriptions` for special rules
    concerning implicit location descriptions created by the
    ``DW_OP_implicit_pointer`` and ``DW_OP_LLVM_implicit_aspace_pointer``
    operations.

    *While the size of the pushed value could be inferred from the base type
    definition, it is encoded explicitly into the operation so that the
    operation can be parsed easily without reference to the* ``.debug_info``
    *section.*

7.  ``DW_OP_xderef`` *Deprecated*

    ``DW_OP_xderef`` pops two stack entries. The first must be an integral type
    value that is treated as an address A. The second must be an integral type
    value that is treated as an address space identifier AS for those
    architectures that support multiple address spaces.

    The operation is equivalent to performing ``DW_OP_swap;
    DW_OP_LLVM_form_aspace_address; DW_OP_deref``. The retrieved generic type
    value V is left on the stack.

8.  ``DW_OP_xderef_size`` *Deprecated*

    ``DW_OP_xderef_size`` has a single 1-byte unsigned integral constant treated
    as a byte result size S.

    It pops two stack entries. The first must be an integral type value that is
    treated as an address A. The second must be an integral type value that is
    treated as an address space identifier AS for those architectures that
    support multiple address spaces.

    The operation is equivalent to performing ``DW_OP_swap;
    DW_OP_LLVM_form_aspace_address; DW_OP_deref_size S``. The zero-extended
    retrieved generic type value V is left on the stack.

9.  ``DW_OP_xderef_type`` *Deprecated*

    ``DW_OP_xderef_type`` has two operands. The first is a 1-byte unsigned
    integral constant S whose value is the same as the size of the base type
    referenced by the second operand. The second operand is an unsigned LEB128
    integer R that represents the offset of a debugging information entry E in
    the current compilation unit, which must be a ``DW_TAG_base_type`` entry
    that provides the type of the result value.

    It pops two stack entries. The first must be an integral type value that is
    treated as an address A. The second must be an integral type value that is
    treated as an address space identifier AS for those architectures that
    support multiple address spaces.

    The operation is equivalent to performing ``DW_OP_swap;
    DW_OP_LLVM_form_aspace_address; DW_OP_deref_type S R``. The retrieved result
    type value V is left on the stack.

10. ``DW_OP_push_object_address``

    ``DW_OP_push_object_address`` pushes the location description L of the
    object currently being evaluated as part of evaluation of a user presented
    expression.

    This object may correspond to an independent variable described by its own
    debugging information entry or it may be a component of an array, structure,
    or class whose address has been dynamically determined by an earlier step
    during user expression evaluation.

    *This operator provides explicit functionality (especially for arrays
    involving descriptions) that is analogous to the implicit push of the base
    address of a structure prior to evaluation of a
    ``DW_AT_data_member_location`` to access a data member of a structure.*

11. ``DW_OP_call2, DW_OP_call4, DW_OP_call_ref``

    ``DW_OP_call2``, ``DW_OP_call4``, and ``DW_OP_call_ref`` perform DWARF
    procedure calls during evaluation of a DWARF expression or location
    description.

    ``DW_OP_call2`` and ``DW_OP_call4``, have one operand that is a 2- or 4-byte
    unsigned offset, respectively, of a debugging information entry D in the
    current compilation unit.

    ``DW_OP_LLVM_call_ref`` has one operand that is a 4-byte unsigned value in
    the 32-bit DWARF format, or an 8-byte unsigned value in the 64-bit DWARF
    format, that is treated as an offset of a debugging information entry D in a
    ``.debug_info`` section, which may be contained in an executable or shared
    object file other than that containing the operator. For references from one
    executable or shared object file to another, the relocation must be
    performed by the consumer.

    *Operand interpretation of* ``DW_OP_call2``\ *,* ``DW_OP_call4``\ *, and*
    ``DW_OP_call_ref`` *is exactly like that for* ``DW_FORM_ref2``\ *,
    ``DW_FORM_ref4``\ *, and* ``DW_FORM_ref_addr``\ *, respectively.*

    If D has a ``DW_AT_location`` attribute, then the DWARF expression E
    corresponding to the current program location is selected.

    .. note::

      To allow ``DW_OP_call*`` to compute the location description for any
      variable or formal parameter regardless of whether the producer has
      optimized it to a constant, the following rule could be added:

      .. note::

        If D has a ``DW_AT_const_value`` attribute, then a DWARF expression E
        consisting a ``DW_OP_implicit_value`` operation with the value of the
        ``DW_AT_const_value`` attribute is selected.

      This would be consistent with ``DW_OP_implicit_pointer``.

      Alternatively, could deprecate using ``DW_AT_const_value`` for
      ``DW_TAG_variable`` and ``DW_TAG_formal_parameter`` debugger information
      entries that are constants and instead use ``DW_AT_location`` with an
      implicit location description instead, then this rule would not be
      required.

    Otherwise, an empty expression E is selected.

    If D is a ``DW_TAG_dwarf_procedure`` debugging information entry, then E is
    evaluated using the same DWARF expression stack. Any existing stack entries
    may be accessed and/or removed in the evaluation of E, and the evaluation of
    E may add any new stack entries.

    *Values on the stack at the time of the call may be used as parameters by
    the called expression and values left on the stack by the called expression
    may be used as return values by prior agreement between the calling and
    called expressions.*

    Otherwise, E is evaluated on a separate DWARF stack and the resulting
    location description L is pushed on the ``DW_OP_call*`` operation's stack.

    .. note:

      In DWARF 5, if D does not have a ``DW_AT_location`` then ``DW_OP_call*``
      is defined to have no effect. It is unclear that this is the right
      definition as a producer should be able to rely on using ``DW_OP_call*``
      to get a location description for any non-\ ``DW_TAG_dwarf_procedure``
      debugging information entries, and should not be creating DWARF with
      ``DW_OP_call*`` to a ``DW_TAG_dwarf_procedure`` that does not have a
      ``DW_AT_location`` attribute.

12. ``DW_OP_LLVM_call_frame_entry_reg`` *New*

    ``DW_OP_LLVM_call_frame_entry_reg`` has a single unsigned LEB128 integer
    operand that is treated as a target architecture register number R.

    It pushes a location description L that holds the value of register R on
    entry to the current subprogram as defined by the Call Frame Information
    (see :ref:`amdgpu-call-frame-information`).

    *If there is no Call Frame Information defined, then the default rules for
    the target architecture are used. If the register rule is* undefined\ *,
    then the undefined location description is pushed. If the register rule is*
    same value\ *, then a register location description for R is pushed.*

Undefined Location Descriptions
###############################

The undefined location storage represents a piece or all of an object that is
present in the source but not in the object code (perhaps due to optimization).
Neither reading or writing to the undefined location storage is meaningful.

An undefined location description specifies the undefined location storage.
There is no concept of the size of the undefined location storage, nor of a bit
offset for an undefined location description. The ``DW_OP_LLVM_*offset``
operations leave an undefined location description unchanged. The
``DW_OP_*piece`` operations can explicitly or implicitly specify an undefined
location description, allowing any size and offset to be specified, and results
in a part with all undefined bits.

1.  ``DW_OP_LLVM_undefined`` *New*

    ``DW_OP_LLVM_undefined`` pushes an undefined location description L.

Memory Location Descriptions
############################

There is a memory location storage that corresponds to each of the target
architecture linear memory address spaces. The size of each memory location
storage corresponds to the range of the addresses in the address space.

*It is target architecture defined how address space location storage maps to
target architecture physical memory. For example, they may be independent memory
or more than one location storage may alias the same physical memory possibly at
different offsets and with different interleaving. The mapping may also be
dictated by the source language address classes.*

A memory location description specifies a memory location storage. The bit
offset corresponds to an address in the address space scaled by 8 (the byte
size). Bits accessed using a memory location description, access the
corresponding target architecture memory starting at the bit offset.

``DW_ASPACE_none`` is defined as the target architecture default address space.

*The target architecture default address space for AMDGPU is the global address
space.*

If a stack entry is required to be a location description, but it is a value
with the generic type, then it is implicitly convert to a memory location
description that specifies memory in the target architecture default address
space with a bit offset equal to the value scaled by 8 (the byte size).

  .. note::

    If want to allow any integral type value to be implicitly converted to a
    memory location description in the target architecture default address
    space:

    .. note::

      If a stack entry is required to be a location description, but it is a
      value with an integral type, then it is implicitly convert to a memory
      location description. The stack entry value is zero extended to the size
      of the generic type and the least significant generic type size bits are
      treated as a twos-complement unsigned value to be used as an address. The
      converted memory location description specifies memory location storage
      corresponding to the target architecture default address space with a bit
      offset equal to the address scaled by 8 (the byte size).

    The implicit conversion could also be defined as target specific. For
    example, gdb checks if the value is an integral type. If it is not it gives
    an error. Otherwise, gdb zero-extends the value to 64 bits. If the gdb
    target defines a hook function then it is called and it can modify the 64
    bit value, possibly sign extending the original value. Finally, gdb treats
    the 64 bit value as a memory location address.

If a stack entry is required to be a location description, but it is an implicit
pointer value IPV with the target architecture default address space, then it is
implicitly convert to the location description specified by IPV. See
:ref:`amdgpu-implicit-location-descriptions`.

If a stack entry is required to be a value with a generic type, but it is a
memory location description in the target architecture default address space
with a bit offset that is a multiple of 8, then it is implicitly converted to a
value with a generic type that is equal to the bit offset divided by 8 (the byte
size).

1.  ``DW_OP_addr``

    ``DW_OP_addr`` has a single byte constant value operand, which has the size
    of the generic type, treated as an address A.

    It pushes a memory location description L on the stack that specifies the
    memory location storage for the target architecture default address space
    with a bit offset equal to A scaled by 8 (the byte size).

    *If the DWARF is part of a code object, then A may need to be relocated. For
    example, in the ELF code object format, A must be adjusted by the difference
    between the ELF segment virtual address and the virtual address at which the
    segment is loaded.*

2.  ``DW_OP_addrx``

    ``DW_OP_addrx`` has a single unsigned LEB128 integer operand that is treated
    as a zero-based index into the ``.debug_addr`` section relative to the value
    of the ``DW_AT_addr_base`` attribute of the associated compilation unit. The
    address value A in the ``.debug_addr`` section has the size of generic type.

    It pushes a memory location description L on the stack that specifies the
    memory location storage for the target architecture default address space
    with a bit offset equal to A scaled by 8 (the byte size).

    *If the DWARF is part of a code object, then A may need to be relocated. For
    example, in the ELF code object format, A must be adjusted by the difference
    between the ELF segment virtual address and the virtual address at which the
    segment is loaded.*

3.  ``DW_OP_LLVM_form_aspace_address`` *New*

    ``DW_OP_LLVM_form_aspace_address`` pops top two stack entries. The first
    must be an integral type value that is treated as an address space
    identifier AS for those architectures that support multiple address spaces.
    The second must be an integral type value that is treated as an address A.

    The address size S is defined as the address bit size of the target
    architecture's address space that corresponds to AS.

    A is adjusted by zero extending it to S bits and the least significant S
    bits are treated as a twos-complement unsigned value.

    ``DW_OP_LLVM_form_aspace_address`` pushes a memory location description L
    that specifies the memory location storage that corresponds to AS, with a
    bit offset equal to the adjusted A scaled by 8 (the byte size).

    If AS is not one of the values defined by the target architecture's
    ``DW_ASPACE_*`` values, then the DWARF expression is ill-formed.

    See :ref:`amdgpu-implicit-location-descriptions` for special rules
    concerning implicit pointer values produced by dereferencing implicit
    location descriptions created by the ``DW_OP_implicit_pointer`` and
    ``DW_OP_LLVM_implicit_aspace_pointer`` operations.

    The AMDGPU address spaces are defined in
    :ref:`amdgpu-dwarf-address-space-mapping-table`.

4.  ``DW_OP_form_tls_address``

    ``DW_OP_form_tls_address`` pops one stack entry that must be an integral
    type value, and treats it as a thread-local storage address.

    ``DW_OP_form_tls_address`` pushes a memory location description L for the
    target architecture default address space that corresponds to the
    thread-local storage address.

    The meaning of the thread-local storage address is defined by the run-time
    environment. If the run-time environment supports multiple thread-local
    storage blocks for a single thread, then the block corresponding to the
    executable or shared library containing this DWARF expression is used.

    *Some implementations of C, C++, Fortran, and other languages, support a
    thread-local storage class. Variables with this storage class have distinct
    values and addresses in distinct threads, much as automatic variables have
    distinct values and addresses in each function invocation. Typically, there
    is a single block of storage containing all thread-local variables declared
    in the main executable, and a separate block for the variables declared in
    each shared library. Each thread-local variable can then be accessed in its
    block using an identifier. This identifier is typically an offset into the
    block and pushed onto the DWARF stack by one of the* ``DW_OP_const<n><x>``
    *operations prior to the* ``DW_OP_form_tls_address`` *operation. Computing
    the address of the appropriate block can be complex (in some cases, the
    compiler emits a function call to do it), and difficult to describe using
    ordinary DWARF location descriptions. Instead of forcing complex
    thread-local storage calculations into the DWARF expressions, the*
    ``DW_OP_form_tls_address`` *allows the consumer to perform the computation
    based on the run-time environment.*

5.  ``DW_OP_call_frame_cfa``

    ``DW_OP_call_frame_cfa`` pushes the memory location description L of the
    Canonical Frame Address (CFA) of the current function, obtained from the
    Call Frame Information (see :ref:`amdgpu-call-frame-information`).

    *Although the value of* ``DW_AT_frame_base`` *can be computed using other
    DWARF expression operators, in some cases this would require an extensive
    location list because the values of the registers used in computing the CFA
    change during a subroutine. If the Call Frame Information is present, then
    it already encodes such changes, and it is space efficient to reference
    that.*

6.  ``DW_OP_fbreg``

    ``DW_OP_fbreg`` has a single signed LEB128 integer operand that is treated
    as a byte displacement D.

    The DWARF expression E corresponding to the current program location is
    selected from the ``DW_AT_frame_base`` attribute of the current function and
    evaluated. The resulting memory location description L's bit offset is
    updated as if the ``DW_OP_LLVM_offset D`` operation were applied. The
    updated L is pushed.

    *This is typically a stack pointer register plus or minus some offset.*

7.  ``DW_OP_breg0, DW_OP_breg1, ..., DW_OP_breg31``

    The ``DW_OP_breg<n>`` operations encode the numbers of up to 32 registers,
    numbered from 0 through 31, inclusive. The register number R corresponds to
    the ``n`` in the operation name.

    They have a single signed LEB128 integer operand that is treated as a byte
    displacement D.

    The address space identifier AS is defined as the one corresponding to the
    target architecture's default address space.

    The address size S is defined as the address bit size of the target
    architecture's address space corresponding to AS.

    The contents of the register specified by R is retrieved as a
    twos-complement unsigned value and zero extended to S bits. D is added and
    the least significant S bits are treated as a twos-complement unsigned value
    to be used as an address A.

    They push a memory location description L that specifies the memory location
    storage that corresponds to AS, with a bit offset equal to A scaled by 8
    (the byte size).

8.  ``DW_OP_bregx``

    ``DW_OP_bregx`` has two operands. The first is an unsigned LEB128 integer
    that is treated as a register number R. The second is a signed LEB128
    integer that is treated as a byte displacement D.

    The action is the same as for ``DW_OP_breg<n>`` except that R is used as the
    register number and D is used as the byte displacement.

9.  ``DW_OP_LLVM_aspace_bregx`` *New*

    ``DW_OP_LLVM_aspace_bregx`` has two operands. The first is an unsigned
    LEB128 integer that is treated as a register number R. The second is a
    signed LEB128 integer that is treated as a byte displacement D. It pops one
    stack entry that is required to be an integral type value that is treated as
    an address space identifier AS for those architectures that support multiple
    address spaces.

    The action is the same as for ``DW_OP_breg<n>`` except that R is used as the
    register number, D is used as the byte displacement, and AS is used as the
    address space identifier.

    If AS is not one of the values defined by the target architecture's
    ``DW_ASPACE_*`` values, then the DWARF expression is ill-formed.

    .. note::

      Could also consider adding ``DW_OP_aspace_breg0, DW_OP_aspace_breg1, ...,
      DW_OP_aspace_bref31`` which would save encoding size.

Register Location Descriptions
##############################

There is a register location storage that corresponds to each of the target
architecture registers. The size of each register location storage corresponds
to the size of the corresponding target architecture register.

A register location description specifies a register location storage. The bit
offset corresponds to a bit position within the register. Bits accessed using a
register location description, access the corresponding target architecture
register starting at the bit offset.

1.  ``DW_OP_reg0, DW_OP_reg1, ..., DW_OP_reg31``

    ``DW_OP_reg<n>`` operations encode the numbers of up to 32 registers,
    numbered from 0 through 31, inclusive. The target architecture register
    number R corresponds to the ``n`` in the operation name.

    ``DW_OP_reg<n>`` pushes a register location description L that specifies the
    register location storage that corresponds to R, with a bit offset of 0.

2.  ``DW_OP_regx``

    ``DW_OP_regx`` has a single unsigned LEB128 integer operand that is treated
    as a target architecture register number R.

    ``DW_OP_regx`` pushes a register location description L that specifies the
    register location storage that corresponds to R, with a bit offset of 0.

*These operations name a register location. To fetch the contents of a register,
it is necessary to use* ``DW_OP_regval_type``\ *, or one of the register based
addressing operations such as* ``DW_OP_bregx``\ *, or using* ``DW_OP_deref*``
*on a register location description.*

.. _amdgpu-implicit-location-descriptions:

Implicit Location Descriptions
##############################

Implicit location storage represents a piece or all of an object which has no
actual location in the program but whose contents are nonetheless known, either
as a constant or can be computed from other locations and values in the program.

An implicit location description specifies an implicit location storage. The bit
offset corresponds to a bit position within the implicit location storage. Bits
accessed using an implicit location description, access the corresponding
implicit storage value starting at the bit offset.

1.  ``DW_OP_implicit_value``

    ``DW_OP_implicit_value`` has two operands. The first is an unsigned LEB128
    integer treated as a byte size S. The second is a block of bytes with a
    length equal to S treated as a literal value V.

    An implicit location storage LS is created with the literal value V and a
    size of S. An implicit location description L is pushed that specifies LS
    with a bit offset of 0.

2.  ``DW_OP_stack_value``

    ``DW_OP_stack_value`` pops one stack entry that must be a value treated as a
    literal value V.

    An implicit location storage LS is created with the literal value V and a
    size equal to V's base type size. An implicit location description L is
    pushed that specifies LS with a bit offset of 0.

    The ``DW_OP_stack_value`` operation specifies that the object does not exist
    in memory but its value is nonetheless known and is at the top of the DWARF
    expression stack. In this form of location description, the DWARF expression
    represents the actual value of the object, rather than its location.

    See :ref:`amdgpu-implicit-location-descriptions` for special rules
    concerning implicit pointer values produced by dereferencing implicit
    location descriptions created by the ``DW_OP_implicit_pointer`` and
    ``DW_OP_LLVM_implicit_aspace_pointer`` operations.

    .. note::

      Since location descriptions are allowed on the stack, the
      ``DW_OP_stack_value`` operation no longer terminates the DWARF expression.

3.  ``DW_OP_implicit_pointer``

    *An optimizing compiler may eliminate a pointer, while still retaining the
    value that the pointer addressed.* ``DW_OP_implicit_pointer`` *allows a
    producer to describe this value.*

    ``DW_OP_implicit_pointer`` specifies that the object is a pointer to the
    target architecture default address space that cannot be represented as a
    real pointer, even though the value it would point to can be described. In
    this form of location description, the DWARF expression refers to a
    debugging information entry that represents the actual location description
    of the object to which the pointer would point. Thus, a consumer of the
    debug information would be able to access the the dereferenced pointer, even
    when it cannot access of the pointer itself.

    ``DW_OP_implicit_pointer`` has two operands. The first is a 4-byte unsigned
    value in the 32-bit DWARF format, or an 8-byte unsigned value in the 64-bit
    DWARF format, that is treated as a debugging information entry reference R.
    The second is a signed LEB128 integer that is treated as a byte
    displacement D.

    R is used as the offset of a debugging information entry E in a
    ``.debug_info`` section, which may be contained in an executable or shared
    object file other than that containing the operator. For references from one
    executable or shared object file to another, the relocation must be
    performed by the consumer.

    *The first operand interpretation is exactly like that for*
    ``DW_FORM_ref_addr``\ *.*

    The address space identifier AS is defined as the one corresponding to the
    target architecture's default address space.

    The address size S is defined as the address bit size of the target
    architecture's address space corresponding to AS.

    An implicit location storage LS is created that has the bit size of S. An
    implicit location description L is pushed that specifies LS and has a bit
    offset of 0.

    If a ``DW_OP_deref*`` operation pops a location description L' and retrieves
    S' bits where some retrieved bits come from LS such that either:

    1.  L' is an implicit location description that specifies LS with bit offset
        0, and S' equals S.

    2.  L' is a complete composite location description that specifies a
        canonical form composite location storage LS'. The bits retrieved all
        come from a single part P' of LS'. P' has a bit size of S and has
        an implicit location description PL'. PL' specifies LS with a bit offset
        of 0.

    Then the value V pushed by the ``DW_OP_deref*`` operation is an implicit
    pointer value IPV with an address space of AS, a debugging information entry
    of E, and a base type of T. If AS is the target architecture default address
    space, then T is the generic type. Otherwise, T is an architecture specific
    integral type with a bit size equal to S.

    Otherwise, if a ``DW_OP_deref*`` operation is applied to a location
    description such that some retrieved bits come from LS, then the DWARF
    expression is ill-formed.

    If IPV is either implicitly converted to a location description (only done
    if AS is the target architecture default address space) or used by
    ``DW_OP_LLVM_form_aspace_address`` (only done if the address space specified
    is AS), then the resulting location description is:

    * If E has a ``DW_AT_location`` attribute, the DWARF expression
      corresponding to the current program location is selected and evaluated
      from the ``DW_AT_location`` attribute. The expression result is the
      resulting location description RL.

    * If E has a ``DW_AT_const_value`` attribute, then an implicit location
      storage RLS is created from the ``DW_AT_const_value`` attribute's value,
      with a size matching the size of the ``DW_AT_const_value`` attribute's
      value. The resulting implicit location description RL specifies RLS with a
      bit offset of 0.

      .. note::

        If deprecate using ``DW_AT_const_value`` for variables and formal
        parameters and instead use ``DW_AT_location`` with an implicit location
        description instead, then this rule would not be required.

    * Otherwise the DWARF expression is ill-formed.

    The bit offset of RL is updated as if the ``DW_OP_LLVM_offset D`` operation
    were applied.

    If a ``DW_OP_stack_value`` operation pops a value that is the same as IPV,
    then it pushes a location description that is the same as L.

    The DWARF expression is ill-formed if it accesses LS or IPV in any other
    manner.

    *The restrictions on how an implicit pointer location description created by
    ``DW_OP_implicit_pointer`` and ``DW_OP_LLVM_aspace_implicit_pointer``, or an
    implicit pointer value created by ``DW_OP_deref*``, can be used are to
    simplify the DWARF consumer.*

4.  ``DW_OP_LLVM_aspace_implicit_pointer`` *New*

    ``DW_OP_LLVM_aspace_implicit_pointer`` has two operands that are the same as
    for ``DW_OP_implicit_pointer``.

    It pops one stack entry that must be an integral type value that is treated
    as an address space identifier AS for those architectures that support
    multiple address spaces.

    The implicit location description L that is pushed is the same as for
    ``DW_OP_implicit_pointer`` except that the address space identifier used is
    AS.

    If AS is not one of the values defined by the target architecture's
    ``DW_ASPACE_*`` values, then the DWARF expression is ill-formed.

*The debugging information entry referenced by a* ``DW_OP_implicit_pointer`` or
``DW_OP_LLVM_aspace_implicit_pointer`` *operation is typically a*
``DW_TAG_variable`` *or* ``DW_TAG_formal_parameter`` *entry whose*
``DW_AT_location`` *attribute gives a second DWARF expression or a location list
that describes the value of the object, but the referenced entry may be any
entry that contains a* ``DW_AT_location`` *or* ``DW_AT_const_value`` *attribute
(for example,* ``DW_TAG_dwarf_procedure``\ *). By using the second DWARF
expression, a consumer can reconstruct the value of the object when asked to
dereference the pointer described by the original DWARF expression containing
the* ``DW_OP_implicit_pointer`` or ``DW_OP_LLVM_aspace_implicit_pointer``
*operation.*

Composite Location Descriptions
###############################

A composite location storage represents an object or value which may be
contained in part of another location storage, or contained in parts of more
than one location storage.

Each part has a part location description L and a part bit size S. The bits of
the part comprise S contiguous bits from the location storage specified by L,
starting at the bit offset specified by L. All the bits must be within the size
of the location storage specified by L or the DWARF expression is ill-formed.

A composite location storage can have zero or more parts. The parts are
contiguous such that the zero-based location storage bit index will range over
each part with no gaps between them. Therefore, the size of a composite location
storage is the size of its parts. The DWARF expression is ill-formed if the size
of the contiguous location storage is larger than the size of the memory
location storage corresponding to the target architecture's largest address
space.

The canonical form of a composite location storage is computed by applying the
following steps to a composite location storage:

1.  If any part P has a composite location description L, it is replaced by a
    copy of the parts of the composite location storage specified by L that are
    selected by the bit size of P starting at the bit offset of L. The location
    description of the first copied part has its bit offset updated as
    necessary, and the last copied part has its bit size updated as necessary,
    to reflect the bits selected by P. This rule is applied repeatedly until no
    part has a composite location description.

2.  If the size on any part is zero, it is removed.

3.  If any adjacent parts P\ :sup:`1` to P\ :sup:`n` have location descriptions
    that specify the same location storage LS such that the bits selected form a
    contiguous portion of LS, then they are replaced by a single new part P'. P'
    has a location description L that specifies LS with the same bit offset as
    P\ :sup:`1`\ 's location description, and a bit size equal to the sum of the
    bit sizes of P\ :sup:`1` to P\ :sup:`n` inclusive.

A composite location description specifies the canonical form of a composite
location storage and a bit offset.

There are operations that push a composite location description that specifies a
composite location storage that is created by the operation.

There are other operations that allow a composite location storage and a
composite location description that specifies it to be created incrementally.
Each part is described by a separate operation. There may be one or more
operations to create the final composite location storage and associated
description. A series of such operations describes the parts of the composite
location storage that are in the order that the associated part operations are
executed.

To support incremental creation, a composite location description can be in an
incomplete state. When an incremental operation operates on an incomplete
composite location description, it adds a new part, otherwise it creates a new
composite location description. The ``DW_OP_LLVM_piece_end`` operation
explicitly makes an incomplete composite location description complete.

If the top stack entry is an incomplete composite location description after the
execution of a DWARF expression has completed, it is converted to a complete
composite location description.

If a stack entry is required to be a location description, but it is an
incomplete composite location description, then the DWARF expression is
ill-formed.

*Note that a DWARF expression may arbitrarily compose composite location
descriptions from any other location description, including other composite
location descriptions.*

*The incremental composite location description operations are defined to be
compatible with the definitions in DWARF 5 and earlier.*

1.  ``DW_OP_piece``

    ``DW_OP_piece`` has a single unsigned LEB128 integer that is treated as a
    byte size S.

    The action is based on the context:

    * If the stack is empty, then an incomplete composite location description
      L is pushed that specifies a new composite location storage LS and has a
      bit offset of 0. LS has a single part P that specifies the undefined
      location description, and has a bit size of S scaled by 8 (the byte size).

    * If the top stack entry is an incomplete composite location description L,
      then the composite location storage LS that it specifies is updated to
      append a part that specifies an undefined location description, and has a
      bit size S scaled by 8 (the byte size).

    * If the top stack entry is a location description or can be converted to
      one, then it is popped and treated as a part location description PL.
      Then:

      * If the stack is empty or the top stack entry is not an incomplete
        composite location description, then an incomplete composite location
        description L is pushed that specifies a new composite location storage
        LS. LS has a single part that specifies PL, and has a bit size of S
        scaled by 8 (the byte size).

      * Otherwise, the composite location storage LS specified by the top stack
        incomplete composite location description L is updated to append a part
        that specifies PL, and has a bit size S scaled by 8 (the byte size).

    * Otherwise, the DWARF expression is ill-formed

    If LS is not in canonical form it is updated to be in canonical form.

    *Many compilers store a single variable in sets of registers, or store a
    variable partially in memory and partially in registers.* ``DW_OP_piece``
    *provides a way of describing how large a part of a variable a particular
    DWARF location description refers to.*

    *If a computed byte displacement is required, the* ``DW_OP_LLVM_offset``
    *can be used to update the part location description.*

2.  ``DW_OP_bit_piece``

    ``DW_OP_bit_piece`` has two operands. The first is an unsigned LEB128
    integer that is treated as the part bit size S. The second is an unsigned
    LEB128 integer that is treated as a bit displacement D.

    The action is the same as for ``DW_OP_piece`` except that any part created
    has the bit size S, and the location description of any created part has its
    bit offset updated as if the ``DW_OP_LLVM_bit_offset D`` operation were
    applied.

    *If a computed bit displacement is required, the* ``DW_OP_LLVM_bit_offset``
    *can be used to update the part location description.*

    .. note::

      The bit offset operand is not needed as ``DW_OP_LLVM_bit_offset`` can be
      used on the part's location description.

3.  ``DW_OP_LLVM_piece_end`` *New*

    If the top stack entry is an incomplete composite location description L,
    then it is updated to be a complete composite location description with the
    same parts. Otherwise, the DWARF expression is ill-formed.

4.  ``DW_OP_LLVM_extend`` *New*

    ``DW_OP_LLVM_extend`` has two operands. The first is an unsigned LEB128
    integer that is treated as the element bit size S. The second is an unsigned
    LEB128 integer that is treated as a count C.

    It pops one stack entry that must be a location description and is treated
    as the part location description PL.

    A complete composite location description L is pushed that comprises C parts
    that each specify PL and have a bit size of S.

    The DWARF expression is ill-formed if the element bit size or count are 0.

5.  ``DW_OP_LLVM_select_bit_piece`` *New*

    ``DW_OP_LLVM_select_bit_piece`` has two operands. The first is an unsigned
    LEB128 integer that is treated as the element bit size S. The second is an
    unsigned LEB128 integer that is treated as a count C.

    It pops three stack entries. The first must be an integral type value that
    is treated as a bit mask value M. The second must be a location description
    that is treated as the one-location description L1. The third must be a
    location description that is treated as the zero-location description L0.

    A complete composite location description L is pushed that specifies a new
    composite location storage LS. LS comprises C parts that each specify a part
    location description PL and have a bit size of S. The PL for part N is
    defined as:

    1.  If the Nth least significant bit of M is a zero then the PL for part N
        is the same as L0, otherwise it is the same as L1.

    2.  The PL for part N is updated as if the ``DW_OP_LLVM_bit_offset N*S``
        operation was applied.

    If LS is not in canonical form it is updated to be in canonical form.

    The DWARF expression is ill-formed if S or C are 0, or if the bit size of M
    is less than C.

``DW_OP_bit_piece`` *is used instead of* ``DW_OP_piece`` *when the piece to be
assembled into a value or assigned to is not byte-sized or is not at the start
of the part location description.*

.. note::

  For AMDGPU:

  * In CFI expressions ``DW_OP_LLVM_select_bit_piece`` is used to describe
    unwinding vector registers that are spilled under the execution mask to
    memory: the zero location description is the vector register, and the one
    location description is the spilled memory location. The
    ``DW_OP_LLVM_form_aspace_address`` is used to specify the address space of
    the memory location description.

  * ``DW_OP_LLVM_select_bit_piece`` is used by the ``lane_pc`` attribute
    expression where divergent control flow is controlled by the execution mask.
    An undefined location description together with ``DW_OP_LLVM_extend`` is
    used to indicate the lane was not active on entry to the subprogram.

.. _amdgpu-dwarf-debugging-information-entry-attributes:

Debugging Information Entry Attributes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This section provides changes to existing debugger information attributes and
defines attributes added by the AMDGPU target.

1.  ``DW_AT_location``

    If the result of the ``DW_AT_location`` DWARF expression is required to be a
    location description, then it may have any kind of location description (see
    :ref:`amdgpu-location-description-operations`).

2.  ``DW_AT_const_value``

    .. note::

      Could deprecate using the ``DW_AT_const_value`` attribute for
      ``DW_TAG_variable`` or ``DW_TAG_formal_parameter`` debugger information
      entries that are constants. Instead, ``DW_AT_location`` could be used with
      a DWARF expression that produces an implicit location description now that
      any location description can be used within a DWARF expression. This
      allows the ``DW_OP_call*`` operations to be used to push the location
      description of any variable regardless of how it is optimized.

3.  ``DW_AT_frame_base``

    A ``DW_TAG_subprogram`` or ``DW_TAG_entry_point`` debugger information entry
    may have a ``DW_AT_frame_base`` attribute, whose value is a DWARF expression
    or location list that describes the *frame base* for the subroutine or entry
    point.

    If the result of the DWARF expression is a register location description,
    then the ``DW_OP_deref`` operation is applied to compute the frame base
    memory location description in the target architecture default address
    space.

    .. note::

      This rule could be removed and require the producer to create the
      required location descriptor directly using ``DW_OP_call_frame_cfa``,
      ``DW_OP_fbreg``, ``DW_OP_breg*``, or ``DW_OP_LLVM-aspace_bregx``. This
      would also then allow a target to implement the call frames withing a
      large register.

    Otherwise, the result of the DWARF expression is required to be a memory
    location description in any of the target architecture address spaces which
    is the frame base.

4.  ``DW_AT_data_member_location``

    For a ``DW_AT_data_member_location`` attribute there are two cases:

    1.  If the value is an integer constant, it is the offset in bytes from the
        beginning of the containing entity. If the beginning of the containing
        entity has a non-zero bit offset then the beginning of the member entry
        has that same bit offset as well.

    2.  Otherwise, the value must be a DWARF expression or location list. The
        DWARF expression E corresponding to the current program location is
        selected. The location description of the beginning of the containing
        entity is pushed on the DWARF stack before E is evaluated. The result of
        the evaluation is the location description of the base of the member
        entry.

        .. note::

          The beginning of the containing entity can now be any location
          description and can be bit aligned.

5.  ``DW_AT_use_location``

    The ``DW_TAG_ptr_to_member_type`` debugging information entry has a
    ``DW_AT_use_location`` attribute whose value is a DWARF expression or
    location list. The DWARF expression E corresponding to the current program
    location is selected. It is used to computes the location description of the
    member of the class to which the pointer to member entry points

    *The method used to find the location description of a given member of a
    class or structure is common to any instance of that class or structure and
    to any instance of the pointer or member type. The method is thus associated
    with the type entry, rather than with each instance of the type.*

    The ``DW_AT_use_location`` description is used in conjunction with the
    location descriptions for a particular object of the given pointer to member
    type and for a particular structure or class instance.

    Two values are pushed onto the DWARF expression stack before E is evaluated.
    The first value pushed is the value of the pointer to member object itself.
    The second value pushed is the location description of the base of the
    entire structure or union instance containing the member whose address is
    being calculated.

6.  ``DW_AT_data_location``

    The ``DW_AT_data_location`` attribute may be used with any type that
    provides one or more levels of hidden indirection and/or run-time parameters
    in its representation. Its value is a DWARF expression E which computes the
    location description of the data for an object. When this attribute is
    omitted, the location description of the data is the same as the location
    description of the object.

    *E will typically begin with ``DW_OP_push_object_address`` which loads the
    location description of the object which can then serve as a descriptor in
    subsequent calculation.*

7.  ``DW_AT_vtable_elem_location``

    An entry for a virtual function also has a ``DW_AT_vtable_elem_location``
    attribute whose value is a DWARF expression or location list. The DWARF
    expression E corresponding to the current program location is selected. The
    location description of the object of the enclosing type is pushed onto the
    expression stack before E is evaluated. The resulting location description
    is the slot for the function within the virtual function table for the
    enclosing class.

8.  ``DW_AT_static_link``

    If a ``DW_TAG_subprogram`` or ``DW_TAG_entry_point`` debugger information
    entry is nested, it may have a ``DW_AT_static_link`` attribute, whose value
    is a DWARF expression or location list. The DWARF expression E corresponding
    to the current program location is selected. The result of evaluating E is
    the frame base memory location description of the relevant instance of the
    subroutine that immediately encloses the subroutine or entry point.

9.  ``DW_AT_return_addr``

    A ``DW_TAG_subprogram``, ``DW_TAG_inlined_subroutine``, or
    ``DW_TAG_entry_point`` debugger information entry may have a
    ``DW_AT_return_addr`` attribute, whose value is a DWARF expression or
    location list. The DWARF expression E corresponding to the current program
    location is selected. The result of evaluating E is the location description
    for the place where the return address for the subroutine or entry point is
    stored.

    .. note::

      It is unclear why ``DW_TAG_inlined_subroutine`` has a
      ``DW_AT_return_addr`` attribute but not a ``DW_AT_frame_base`` or
      ``DW_AT_static_link`` attribute. Seems it would either have all of them or
      none. Since inlined subprograms do not have a frame it seems they would
      have none of these attributes.

10. ``DW_AT_LLVM_lanes`` *New*

    For languages that are implemented using a SIMD or SIMT execution model, a
    ``DW_TAG_subprogram``, ``DW_TAG_inlined_subroutine``, or
    ``DW_TAG_entry_point`` debugger information entry may have a
    ``DW_AT_LLVM_lanes`` attribute whose value is an integer constant that is
    the number of lanes per thread.

    If not present, the default value of 1 is used.

    The DWARF is ill-formed if the value is 0.

11. ``DW_AT_LLVM_lane_pc`` *New*

    For languages that are implemented using a SIMD or SIMT execution model, a
    ``DW_TAG_subprogram``, ``DW_TAG_inlined_subroutine``, or
    ``DW_TAG_entry_point`` debugging information entry may have a
    ``DW_AT_LLVM_lane_pc`` attribute whose value is a DWARF expression or
    location list. The DWARF expression E corresponding to the current program
    location is selected. The result of evaluating E is a location description
    that references a wave size vector of generic type elements. Each element
    holds the conceptual program location of the corresponding lane, where the
    least significant element corresponds to the first target architecture lane
    identifier and so forth. If the lane was not active when the subprogram was
    called, its element is an undefined location description.

    *``DW_AT_LLVM_lane_pc`` allows the compiler to indicate conceptually where
    each lane of a SIMT thread is positioned even when it is in divergent
    control flow that is not active.*

    If not present, the thread is not being used in a SIMT manner, and the
    thread's program location is used.

    *See* :ref:`amdgpu-dwarf-amdgpu-dw-at-llvm-lane-pc` *for AMDGPU
    information.*

12. ``DW_AT_LLVM_active_lane`` *New*

    For languages that are implemented using a SIMD or SIMT execution model, a
    ``DW_TAG_subprogram``, ``DW_TAG_inlined_subroutine``, or
    ``DW_TAG_entry_point`` debugger information entry may have a
    ``DW_AT_LLVM_active_lane`` attribute whose value is a DWARF expression or
    location list. The DWARF expression E corresponding to the current program
    location is selected. The result of evaluating E is a integral value that is
    the mask of active lanes for the current program location. The Nth least
    significant bit of the mask corresponds to the Nth lane. If the bit is 1 the
    lane is active, otherwise it is inactive.

    *Some targets may update the target architecture execution mask for regions
    of code that must execute with different sets of lanes than the current
    active lanes. For example, some code must execute in whole wave mode.
    ``DW_AT_LLVM_active_lane` allows the compiler can provide the means to
    determine the actual active lanes.*

    If not present and ``DW_AT_LLVM_lanes`` is greater than 1, then the target
    architecture execution mask is used.

    *See* :ref:`amdgpu-dwarf-amdgpu-dw-at-llvm-active-lane` *for AMDGPU
    information.*

13. ``DW_AT_LLVM_vector_size`` *New*

    A base type V may have the ``DW_AT_LLVM_vector_size`` attribute whose value
    is an integer constant that is the vector size S.

    The representation of a vector base type is as S contiguous elements, each
    one having the representation of a base type E that is the same as V without
    the ``DW_AT_LLVM_vector_size`` attribute.

    If not present, the base type is not a vector.

    The DWARF is ill-formed if S not greater than 0.

    .. note::

      LLVM has mention of non-upstreamed debugger information entry that is
      intended to support vector types. However, that was not for a base type
      so would not be suitable as the type of a stack value entry. But perhaps
      that could be replaced by using this attribute.

14. ``DW_AT_LLVM_augmentation`` *New*

    A compilation unit may have a ``DW_AT_LLVM_augmentation`` attribute, whose
    value is an augmentation string.

    *The augmentation string allows users to indicate that there is additional
    target-specific information in the debugging information entries. For
    example, this might be information about the version of target-specific
    extensions that are being used.*

    If not present, or if the string is empty, then the compilation unit has no
    augmentation string.

    .. note::

      For AMDGPU, the augmentation string contains:

      ::

        [amd:v0.0]

      The "vX.Y" specifies the major X and minor Y version number of the AMDGPU
      extensions used in the DWARF of the compilation unit. The version number
      conforms to [SEMVER]_.

Call Frame Information
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

DWARF Call Frame Information describes how an agent can virtually *unwind*
call frames in a running process or core dump.

.. note::

  AMDGPU conforms to the DWARF standard with additional support added for
  address spaces. Register unwind DWARF expressions are generalized to allow any
  location description, including composite and implicit location descriptions.

Structure of Call Frame Information
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The register rules are:

*undefined*
  A register that has this rule has no recoverable value in the previous frame.
  (By convention, it is not preserved by a callee.)

*same value*
  This register has not been modified from the previous frame. (By convention,
  it is preserved by the callee, but the callee has not modified it.)

*offset(N)*
  The previous value of this register is saved at the location description
  computed as if the ``DW_OP_LLVM_offset N`` operation is applied to the current
  CFA memory location description where N is a signed byte offset.

*val_offset(N)*
  The previous value of this register is the address in the address space of the
  memory location description computed as if the ``DW_OP_LLVM_offset N``
  operation is applied to the current CFA memory location description where N is
  a signed byte displacement.

  If the register size does not match the size of an address in the address
  space of the current CFA memory location description, then the DWARF is
  ill-formed .

*register(R)*
  The previous value of this register is stored in another register numbered R.

  If the register sizes do not match, then the DWARF is ill-formed.

*expression(E)*
  The previous value of this register is located at the location description
  produced by executing the DWARF expression E (see
  :ref:`amdgpu-dwarf-expressions`).

*val_expression(E)*
  The previous value of this register is the value produced by executing the
  DWARF expression E (see :ref:`amdgpu-dwarf-expressions`).

  If value type size does not match the register size, then the DWARF is
  ill-formed.

*architectural*
  The rule is defined externally to this specification by the augmenter.

A Common Information Entry holds information that is shared among many Frame
Description Entries. There is at least one CIE in every non-empty
``.debug_frame`` section. A CIE contains the following fields, in order:

1.  ``length`` (initial length)

    A constant that gives the number of bytes of the CIE structure, not
    including the length field itself. The size of the length field plus the
    value of length must be an integral multiple of the address size specified
    in the ``address_size`` field.

2.  ``CIE_id`` (4 or 8 bytes, see
    :ref:`amdgpu-dwarf-32-bit-and-64-bit-dwarf-formats`)

    A constant that is used to distinguish CIEs from FDEs.

    In the 32-bit DWARF format, the value of the CIE id in the CIE header is
    0xffffffff; in the 64-bit DWARF format, the value is 0xffffffffffffffff.

3.  ``version`` (ubyte)

    A version number. This number is specific to the call frame information and
    is independent of the DWARF version number.

    The value of the CIE version number is 4.

4.  ``augmentation`` (sequence of UTF-8 characters)

    A null-terminated UTF-8 string that identifies the augmentation to this CIE
    or to the FDEs that use it. If a reader encounters an augmentation string
    that is unexpected, then only the following fields can be read:

    * CIE: length, CIE_id, version, augmentation
    * FDE: length, CIE_pointer, initial_location, address_range

    If there is no augmentation, this value is a zero byte.

    *The augmentation string allows users to indicate that there is additional
    target-specific information in the CIE or FDE which is needed to virtually
    unwind a stack frame. For example, this might be information about
    dynamically allocated data which needs to be freed on exit from the
    routine.*

    *Because the .debug_frame section is useful independently of any
    ``.debug_info`` section, the augmentation string always uses UTF-8
    encoding.*

    .. note::

      For AMDGPU, the augmentation string contains:

      ::

        [amd:v0.0]

      The "vX.Y" specifies the major X and minor Y version number of the AMDGPU
      extensions used in the DWARF of the compilation unit. The version number
      conforms to [SEMVER]_.

5.  ``address_size`` (ubyte)

    The size of a target address in this CIE and any FDEs that use it, in bytes.
    If a compilation unit exists for this frame, its address size must match the
    address size here.

    .. note::

      For AMDGPU:

      * The address size for the ``Global`` address space defined in
        :ref:`amdgpu-dwarf-address-space-mapping-table`.

6.  ``segment_selector_size`` (ubyte)

    The size of a segment selector in this CIE and any FDEs that use it, in
    bytes.

    .. note::

      For AMDGPU:

      * Does not use a segment selector so this is 0.

7.  ``code_alignment_factor`` (unsigned LEB128)

    A constant that is factored out of all advance location instructions (see
    :ref:`amdgpu-dwarf-row-creation-instructions`). The resulting value is
    ``(operand * code_alignment_factor)``.

    .. note::

      For AMDGPU:

      * 4 bytes.

    .. TODO::

       Add to :ref:`amdgpu-processor-table` table.

8.  ``data_alignment_factor`` (signed LEB128)

    A constant that is factored out of certain offset instructions (see
    :ref:`amdgpu-dwarf-cfa-definition-instructions` and
    :ref:`amdgpu-dwarf-register-rule-instructions`). The resulting value is
    ``(operand * data_alignment_factor)``.

    .. note::

      For AMDGPU:

      * 4 bytes.

    .. TODO::

       Add to :ref:`amdgpu-processor-table` table.

9.  ``return_address_register`` (unsigned LEB128)

    An unsigned LEB128 constant that indicates which column in the rule table
    represents the return address of the function. Note that this column might
    not correspond to an actual machine register.

    .. note::

      For AMDGPU:

      * ``PC_32`` for 32-bit processes and ``PC_64`` for
        64-bit processes defined in :ref:`amdgpu-dwarf-register-mapping`.

10. ``initial_instructions`` (array of ubyte)

    A sequence of rules that are interpreted to create the initial setting of
    each column in the table.

    The default rule for all columns before interpretation of the initial
    instructions is the undefined rule. However, an ABI authoring body or a
    compilation system authoring body may specify an alternate default value for
    any or all columns.

    .. note::

      For AMDGPU:

      * Since a subprogram A with fewer registers can be called from subprogram
        B that has more allocated, A will not change any of the extra registers
        as it cannot access them. Therefore, The default rule for all columns is
        ``same value``.

11. ``padding`` (array of ubyte)

    Enough ``DW_CFA_nop`` instructions to make the size of this entry match the
    length value above.

An FDE contains the following fields, in order:

1.  ``length`` (initial length)

    A constant that gives the number of bytes of the header and instruction
    stream for this function, not including the length field itself. The size of
    the length field plus the value of length must be an integral multiple of
    the address size.

2.  ``CIE_pointer`` (4 or 8 bytes, see
    :ref:`amdgpu-dwarf-32-bit-and-64-bit-dwarf-formats`)

    A constant offset into the ``.debug_frame`` section that denotes the CIE
    that is associated with this FDE.

3.  ``initial_location`` (segment selector and target address)

    The address of the first location associated with this table entry. If the
    segment_selector_size field of this FDE’s CIE is non-zero, the initial
    location is preceded by a segment selector of the given length.

4.  ``address_range`` (target address)

    The number of bytes of program instructions described by this entry.

5.  ``instructions`` (array of ubyte)

    A sequence of table defining instructions that are described in
    :ref:`amdgpu-dwarf-call-frame-instructions`.

6.  ``padding`` (array of ubyte)

    Enough ``DW_CFA_nop`` instructions to make the size of this entry match the
    length value above.

.. _amdgpu-dwarf-call-frame-instructions:

Call Frame Instructions
+++++++++++++++++++++++

Some call frame instructions have operands that are encoded as DWARF expressions
E (see :ref:`amdgpu-dwarf-expressions`). The DWARF operators that can be used in
E have the following restrictions:

* ``DW_OP_addrx``, ``DW_OP_call2``, ``DW_OP_call4``, ``DW_OP_call_ref``,
  ``DW_OP_const_type``, ``DW_OP_constx``, ``DW_OP_convert``,
  ``DW_OP_deref_type``, ``DW_OP_regval_type``, and ``DW_OP_reinterpret``
  operators are not allowed because the call frame information must not depend
  on other debug sections.

* ``DW_OP_push_object_address`` is not allowed because there is no object
  context to provide a value to push.

* ``DW_OP_call_frame_cfa`` and ``DW_OP_entry_value`` are not allowed because
  their use would be circular.

* ``DW_OP_LLVM_call_frame_entry_reg`` is not allowed if evaluating E causes a
  circular dependency between ``DW_OP_LLVM_call_frame_entry_reg`` operators.

  *For example, if a register R1 has a* ``DW_CFA_def_cfa_expression``
  *instruction that evaluates a* ``DW_OP_LLVM_call_frame_entry_reg`` *operator
  that specifies register R2, and register R2 has a*
  ``DW_CFA_def_cfa_expression`` *instruction that that evaluates a*
  ``DW_OP_LLVM_call_frame_entry_reg`` *operator that specifies register R1.*

*Call frame instructions to which these restrictions apply include*
``DW_CFA_def_cfa_expression``\ *,* ``DW_CFA_expression``\ *, and*
``DW_CFA_val_expression``\ *.*

#########################

These instructions are the same as in DWARF 5.

.. _amdgpu-dwarf-cfa-definition-instructions:

CFA Definition Instructions
###########################

1.  ``DW_CFA_def_cfa``

    The ``DW_CFA_def_cfa`` instruction takes two unsigned LEB128 operands
    representing a register number R and a (non-factored) byte displacement D.
    The required action is to define the current CFA rule to be the memory
    location description that is the result of evaluating the DWARF expression
    ``DW_OP_bregx R, D``.

    .. note::

      Could also consider adding ``DW_CFA_def_aspace_cfa`` and
      ``DW_CFA_def_aspace_cfa_sf`` which allow a register R, offset D, and
      address space AS to be specified. For example, that would save a byte of
      encoding over using ``DW_CFA_def_cfa R, D; DW_CFA_LLVM_def_cfa_aspace
      AS;``.

2.  ``DW_CFA_def_cfa_sf``

    The ``DW_CFA_def_cfa_sf`` instruction takes two operands: an unsigned LEB128
    value representing a register number R and a signed LEB128 factored byte
    displacement D. The required action is to define the current CFA rule to be
    the memory location description that is the result of evaluating the DWARF
    expression ``DW_OP_bregx R, D*data_alignment_factor``.

    *The action is the same as ``DW_CFA_def_cfa`` except that the second operand
    is signed and factored.*

3.  ``DW_CFA_def_cfa_register``

    The ``DW_CFA_def_cfa_register`` instruction takes a single unsigned LEB128
    operand representing a register number R. The required action is to define
    the current CFA rule to be the memory location description that is the
    result of evaluating the DWARF expression ``DW_OP_constu AS;
    DW_OP_aspace_bregx R, D`` where D and AS are the old CFA byte displacement
    and address space respectively.

    If the subprogram has no current CFA rule, or the rule was defined by a
    ``DW_CFA_def_cfa_expression`` instruction, then the DWARF is ill-formed.

4.  ``DW_CFA_def_cfa_offset``

    The ``DW_CFA_def_cfa_offset`` instruction takes a single unsigned LEB128
    operand representing a (non-factored) byte displacement D. The required
    action is to define the current CFA rule to be the memory location
    description that is the result of evaluating the DWARF expression
    ``DW_OP_constu AS; DW_OP_aspace_bregx R, D`` where R and AS are the old CFA
    register number and address space respectively.

    If the subprogram has no current CFA rule, or the rule was defined by a
    ``DW_CFA_def_cfa_expression`` instruction, then the DWARF is ill-formed.

5.  ``DW_CFA_def_cfa_offset_sf``

    The ``DW_CFA_def_cfa_offset_sf`` instruction takes a signed LEB128 operand
    representing a factored byte displacement D. The required action is to
    define the current CFA rule to be the memory location description that is
    the result of evaluating the DWARF expression ``DW_OP_constu AS;
    DW_OP_aspace_bregx R, D*data_alignment_factor`` where R and AS are the old
    CFA register number and address space respectively.

    If the subprogram has no current CFA rule, or the rule was defined by a
    ``DW_CFA_def_cfa_expression`` instruction, then the DWARF is ill-formed.

    *The action is the same as ``DW_CFA_def_cfa_offset`` except that the operand
    is signed and factored.*

6.  ``DW_CFA_LLVM_def_cfa_aspace`` *New*

    The ``DW_CFA_LLVM_def_cfa_aspace`` instruction takes a single unsigned
    LEB128 operand representing an address space identifier AS for those
    architectures that support multiple address spaces. The required action is
    to define the current CFA rule to be the memory location description L that
    is the result of evaluating the DWARF expression ``DW_OP_constu AS;
    DW_OP_aspace_bregx R, D`` where R and D are the old CFA register number and
    byte displacement respectively.

    If AS is not one of the values defined by the target architecture's
    ``DW_ASPACE_*`` values then the DWARF expression is ill-formed.

7.  ``DW_CFA_def_cfa_expression``

    The ``DW_CFA_def_cfa_expression`` instruction takes a single operand encoded
    as a ``DW_FORM_exprloc`` value representing a DWARF expression E. The
    required action is to define the current CFA rule to be the memory location
    description computed by evaluating E.

    *See :ref:`amdgpu-dwarf-call-frame-instructions` regarding restrictions on
    the DWARF expression operators that can be used in E.*

    If the result of evaluating E is not a memory location description with bit
    offset that is a multiple of 8 (the byte size), then the DWARF is
    ill-formed.

Register Rule Instructions
##########################

.. note::

  For AMDGPU:

  * The register number follows the numbering defined in
    :ref:`amdgpu-dwarf-register-mapping`.

1.  ``DW_CFA_undefined``

    The ``DW_CFA_undefined`` instruction takes a single unsigned LEB128 operand
    that represents a register number R. The required action is to set the rule
    for the register specified by R to ``undefined``.

2.  ``DW_CFA_same_value``

    The ``DW_CFA_same_value`` instruction takes a single unsigned LEB128 operand
    that represents a register number R. The required action is to set the rule
    for the register specified by R to ``same value``.

3.  ``DW_CFA_offset``

    The ``DW_CFA_offset`` instruction takes two operands: a register number R
    (encoded with the opcode) and an unsigned LEB128 constant representing a
    factored displacement D. The required action is to change the rule for the
    register specified by R to be an *offset(D*data_alignment_factor)* rule.

    .. note::

      Seems this should be named ``DW_CFA_offset_uf`` since the offset is
      unsigned factored.

4.  ``DW_CFA_offset_extended``

    The ``DW_CFA_offset_extended`` instruction takes two unsigned LEB128
    operands representing a register number R and a factored displacement D.
    This instruction is identical to ``DW_CFA_offset`` except for the encoding
    and size of the register operand.

    .. note::

      Seems this should be named ``DW_CFA_offset_extended_uf`` since the
      displacement is unsigned factored.

5.  ``DW_CFA_offset_extended_sf``

    The ``DW_CFA_offset_extended_sf`` instruction takes two operands: an
    unsigned LEB128 value representing a register number R and a signed LEB128
    factored displacement D. This instruction is identical to
    ``DW_CFA_offset_extended`` except that D is signed.

6.  ``DW_CFA_val_offset``

    The ``DW_CFA_val_offset`` instruction takes two unsigned LEB128 operands
    representing a register number R and a factored displacement D. The required
    action is to change the rule for the register indicated by R to be a
    *val_offset(D*data_alignment_factor)* rule.

    .. note::

      Seems this should be named ``DW_CFA_val_offset_uf`` since the displacement
      is unsigned factored.

7.  ``DW_CFA_val_offset_sf``

    The ``DW_CFA_val_offset_sf`` instruction takes two operands: an unsigned
    LEB128 value representing a register number R and a signed LEB128 factored
    displacement D. This instruction is identical to ``DW_CFA_val_offset``
    except that D is signed.

8.  ``DW_CFA_register``

    The ``DW_CFA_register`` instruction takes two unsigned LEB128 operands
    representing register numbers R1 and R2 respectively. The required action is
    to set the rule for the register specified by R1 to be *register(R)* where R
    is R2.

9.  ``DW_CFA_expression``

    The ``DW_CFA_expression`` instruction takes two operands: an unsigned LEB128
    value representing a register number R, and a ``DW_FORM_block`` value
    representing a DWARF expression E. The required action is to change the rule
    for the register specified by R to be an *expression(E)* rule. The memory
    location description of the current CFA is pushed on the DWARF stack prior
    to execution of E.

    *That is, the DWARF expression computes the location description where the
    register value can be retrieved.*

    *See :ref:`amdgpu-dwarf-call-frame-instructions` regarding restrictions on
    the DWARF expression operators that can be used in E.*

10. ``DW_CFA_val_expression``

    The ``DW_CFA_val_expression`` instruction takes two operands: an unsigned
    LEB128 value representing a register number R, and a ``DW_FORM_block`` value
    representing a DWARF expression E. The required action is to change the rule
    for the register specified by R to be a *val_expression(E)* rule. The memory
    location description of the current CFA is pushed on the DWARF evaluation
    stack prior to execution of E.

    *That is, E computes the value of register R.*

    *See :ref:`amdgpu-dwarf-call-frame-instructions` regarding restrictions on
    the DWARF expression operators that can be used in E.*

    If the result of evaluating E is not a value with a base type size that
    matches the register size, then the DWARF is ill-formed.

11. ``DW_CFA_restore``

    The ``DW_CFA_restore`` instruction takes a single operand (encoded with the
    opcode) that represents a register number R. The required action is to
    change the rule for the register specified by R to the rule assigned it by
    the initial_instructions in the CIE.

12. ``DW_CFA_restore_extended``

    The ``DW_CFA_restore_extended`` instruction takes a single unsigned LEB128
    operand that represents a register number R. This instruction is identical
    to ``DW_CFA_restore`` except for the encoding and size of the register
    operand.

Row State Instructions
######################

These instructions are the same as in DWARF 5.

Call Frame Calling Address
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

*When virtually unwinding frames, consumers frequently wish to obtain the
address of the instruction which called a subroutine. This information is not
always provided. Typically, however, one of the registers in the virtual unwind
table is the Return Address.*

If a Return Address register is defined in the virtual unwind table, and its
rule is undefined (for example, by ``DW_CFA_undefined``), then there is no
return address and no call address, and the virtual unwind of stack activations
is complete.

*In most cases the return address is in the same context as the calling address,
but that need not be the case, especially if the producer knows in some way the
call never will return. The context of the ’return address’ might be on a
different line, in a different lexical block, or past the end of the calling
subroutine. If a consumer were to assume that it was in the same context as the
calling address, the virtual unwind might fail.*

*For architectures with constant-length instructions where the return address
immediately follows the call instruction, a simple solution is to subtract the
length of an instruction from the return address to obtain the calling
instruction. For architectures with variable-length instructions (for example,
x86), this is not possible. However, subtracting 1 from the return address,
although not guaranteed to provide the exact calling address, generally will
produce an address within the same context as the calling address, and that
usually is sufficient.*

.. note::

  For AMDGPU the instructions are variable size and a consumer can subtract 1
  from the return address to get the address of a byte within the call site
  instructions.

Lookup By Name
++++++++++++++

.. note::

  For AMDGPU:

  * The rule for debugger information entries included in the name
    index in the optional ``.debug_names`` section is extended to also include
    named ``DW_TAG_variable`` debugging information entries with a
    ``DW_AT_location`` attribute that includes a
    ``DW_OP_LLVM_form_aspace_address`` operation.

  * The lookup by name section header ``augmentation_string`` string field contains:

    ::

      [amd:v0.0]

    The "vX.Y" specifies the major X and minor Y version number of the AMDGPU
    extensions used in the DWARF of the compilation unit. The version number
    conforms to [SEMVER]_.

Lookup By Address
+++++++++++++++++

.. note::

  For AMDGPU:

  * The lookup by address section header table:

    ``address_size`` (ubyte)
      Match the address size for the ``Global`` address space defined in
      :ref:`amdgpu-dwarf-address-space-mapping-table`.

    ``segment_selector_size`` (ubyte)
      AMDGPU does not use a segment selector so this is 0. The entries in the
      ``.debug_aranges`` do not have a segment selector.

32-Bit and 64-Bit DWARF Formats
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

.. note::

  For AMDGPU:

  * For the ``amdgcn`` target only 64-bit process address space is supported
  * The producer can generate either 32-bit or 64-bit DWARF format.

1.  Within the body of the ``.debug_info`` section, certain forms of attribute
    value depend on the choice of DWARF format as follows. For the 32-bit DWARF
    format, the value is a 4-byte unsigned integer; for the 64-bit DWARF format,
    the value is an 8-byte unsigned integer.

Unit Headers

.. note::

  For AMDGPU:

  * For AMDGPU the ``address_size`` field of the DWARF unit headers matches the
    address size for the ``Global`` address space defined in
    :ref:`amdgpu-dwarf-address-space-mapping-table`.

.. _amdgpu-dwarf-amdgpu-dw-at-llvm-lane-pc:

AMDGPU DW_AT_LLVM_lane_pc
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``DW_AT_LLVM_lane_pc`` attribute can be used to specify the program location
of the separate lanes of a SIMT thread. See
:ref:`amdgpu-dwarf-debugging-information-entry-attributes`.

If the lane is an active lane then this will be the same as the current program
location.

If the lane is inactive, but was active on entry to the subprogram, then this is
the program location in the subprogram at which execution of the lane is
conceptual positioned.

If the lane was not active on entry to the subprogram, then this will be the
undefined location. A client debugger can check if the lane is part of a valid
work-group by checking that the lane is in the range of the associated
work-group within the grid, accounting for partial work-groups. If it is not
then the debugger can omit any information for the lane. Otherwise, the debugger
may repeatedly unwind the stack and inspect the ``DW_AT_LLVM_lane_pc`` of the
calling subprogram until it finds a non-undefined location. Conceptually the
lane only has the call frames that it has a non-undefined
``DW_AT_LLVM_lane_pc``.

The following example illustrates how the AMDGPU backend can generate a location
list for the nested ``IF/THEN/ELSE`` structures of the following subprogram
pseudo code for a target with 64 lanes per wave.

.. code::
  :number-lines:

  SUBPROGRAM X
  BEGIN
    a;
    IF (c1) THEN
      b;
      IF (c2) THEN
        c;
      ELSE
        d;
      ENDIF
      e;
    ELSE
      f;
    ENDIF
    g;
  END

The AMDGPU backend may generate the following pseudo LLVM MIR to manipulate the
execution mask (``EXEC``) to linearized the control flow. The condition is
evaluated to make a mask of the lanes for which the condition evaluates to true.
First the ``THEN`` region is executed by setting the ``EXEC`` mask to the
logical ``AND`` of the current ``EXEC`` mask with the condition mask. Then the
``ELSE`` region is executed by negating the ``EXEC`` mask and logical ``AND`` of
the saved ``EXEC`` mask at the start of the region. After the ``IF/THEN/ELSE``
region the ``EXEC`` mask is restored to the value it had at the beginning of the
region. This is shown below. Other approaches are possible, but the basic
concept is the same.

.. code::
  :number-lines:

  $lex_start:
    a;
    %1 = EXEC
    %2 = c1
  $lex_1_start:
    EXEC = %1 & %2
  $if_1_then:
      b;
      %3 = EXEC
      %4 = c2
  $lex_1_1_start:
      EXEC = %3 & %4
  $lex_1_1_then:
        c;
      EXEC = ~EXEC & %3
  $lex_1_1_else:
        d;
      EXEC = %3
  $lex_1_1_end:
      e;
    EXEC = ~EXEC & %1
  $lex_1_else:
      f;
    EXEC = %1
  $lex_1_end:
    g;
  $lex_end:

To create the location list that defines the location description of a vector of
lane program locations, the LLVM MIR ``DBG_VALUE`` pseudo instruction can be
used to annotate the linearized control flow. This can be done by defining an
artificial variable for the lane PC. The location list created for it is used to
define the value of the ``DW_AT_LLVM_lane_pc`` attribute.

A DWARF procedure is defined for each well nested structured control flow region
which provides the conceptual lane program location for a lane if it is not
active (namely it is divergent). The expression for each region inherits the
value of the immediately enclosing region and modifies it according to the
semantics of the region.

For an ``IF/THEN/ELSE`` region the divergent program location is at the start of
the region for the ``THEN`` region since it is executed first. For the ``ELSE``
region the divergent program location is at the end of the ``IF/THEN/ELSE``
region since the ``THEN`` region has completed.

The lane PC artificial variable is assigned at each region transition. It uses
the immediately enclosing region's DWARF procedure to compute the program
location for each lane assuming they are divergent, and then modifies the result
by inserting the current program location for each lane that the ``EXEC`` mask
indicates is active.

By having separate DWARF procedures for each region, they can be reused to
define the value for any nested region. This reduces the amount of DWARF
required.

The following provides an example using pseudo LLVM MIR.

The DWARF procedure ``%__active_lane_pc`` is used to update the lane pc elements
that are active with the current program location.

Artificial variables %__lex_1_save_exec and %__lex_1_1_save_exec are created for
the execution masks saved on entry to a region. Using the ``DBG_VALUE`` pseudo
instruction, location lists that describes where they are allocated at any given
program location will be created. The compiler may allocate them to registers,
or spill them to memory.

The DWARF procedures for each region use saved execution mask value to only
update the lanes that are active on entry to the region. All other lanes retain
the value of the enclosing region where they were last active. If they were not
active on entry to the subprogram, then will have the undefined location
description.

Other structured control flow regions can be handled similarly. For example,
loops would set the divergent program location for the region at the end of the
loop. Any lanes active will be in the loop, and any lanes not active must have
exited the loop.

An ``IF/THEN/ELSEIF/ELSEIF/...`` region can be treated as a nest of
``IF/THEN/ELSE`` regions.

The DWARF procedures can use the active lane artificial variable described in
:ref:`amdgpu-dwarf-amdgpu-dw-at-llvm-active-lane` rather than the actual
``EXEC`` mask in order to support whole or quad wave mode.

.. _amdgpu-dwarf-amdgpu-dw-at-llvm-active-lane:

AMDGPU DW_AT_LLVM_active_lane
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``DW_AT_LLVM_active_lane`` attribute can be used to specify the lanes that
are conceptually active for a SIMT thread. See
:ref:`amdgpu-dwarf-debugging-information-entry-attributes`.

The execution mask may be modified to implement whole or quad wave mode
operations. For example, all lanes may need to temporarily be made active to
execute a whole wave operation. Such regions would save the ``EXEC`` mask,
update it to enable the necessary lanes, perform the operations, and then
restore the ``EXEC`` mask from the saved value. While executing the whole wave
region, the conceptual execution mask is the saved value, not the ``EXEC``
value.

This is handled by defining an artificial variable for the active lane mask. The
active lane mask artificial variable would be the actual ``EXEC`` mask for
normal regions, and the saved execution mask for regions where the mask is
temporarily updated. The location list created for this artificial variable is
used to define the value of the ``DW_AT_LLVM_active_lane`` attribute.

Source Text
~~~~~~~~~~~

Source text for online-compiled programs (e.g. those compiled by the OpenCL
runtime) may be embedded into the DWARF v5 line table using the ``clang
-gembed-source`` option, described in table :ref:`amdgpu-debug-options`.

For example:

``-gembed-source``
  Enable the embedded source DWARF v5 extension.
``-gno-embed-source``
  Disable the embedded source DWARF v5 extension.

Code Conventions
================

This section provides code conventions used for each supported target triple OS
(see :ref:`amdgpu-target-triples`).

AMDHSA
------

This section provides code conventions used when the target triple OS is
``amdhsa`` (see :ref:`amdgpu-target-triples`).

.. _amdgpu-amdhsa-code-object-target-identification:

Code Object Target Identification
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The AMDHSA OS uses the following syntax to specify the code object
target as a single string:

  ``<Architecture>-<Vendor>-<OS>-<Environment>-<Processor><Target Features>``

Where:

  - ``<Architecture>``, ``<Vendor>``, ``<OS>`` and ``<Environment>``
    are the same as the *Target Triple* (see
    :ref:`amdgpu-target-triples`).

  - ``<Processor>`` is the same as the *Processor* (see
    :ref:`amdgpu-processors`).

  - ``<Target Features>`` is a list of the enabled *Target Features*
    (see :ref:`amdgpu-target-features`), each prefixed by a plus, that
    apply to *Processor*. The list must be in the same order as listed
    in the table :ref:`amdgpu-target-feature-table`. Note that *Target
    Features* must be included in the list if they are enabled even if
    that is the default for *Processor*.

For example:

  ``"amdgcn-amd-amdhsa--gfx902+xnack"``

.. _amdgpu-amdhsa-code-object-metadata:

Code Object Metadata
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The code object metadata specifies extensible metadata associated with the code
objects executed on HSA [HSA]_ compatible runtimes such as AMD's ROCm
[AMD-ROCm]_. The encoding and semantics of this metadata depends on the code
object version; see :ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-code-object-metadata-v2` and
:ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-code-object-metadata-v3`.

Code object metadata is specified in a note record (see
:ref:`amdgpu-note-records`) and is required when the target triple OS is
``amdhsa`` (see :ref:`amdgpu-target-triples`). It must contain the minimum
information necessary to support the ROCM kernel queries. For example, the
segment sizes needed in a dispatch packet. In addition, a high level language
runtime may require other information to be included. For example, the AMD
OpenCL runtime records kernel argument information.

.. _amdgpu-amdhsa-code-object-metadata-v2:

Code Object V2 Metadata (-mattr=-code-object-v3)
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

.. warning:: Code Object V2 is not the default code object version emitted by
  this version of LLVM. For a description of the metadata generated with the
  default configuration (Code Object V3) see
  :ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-code-object-metadata-v3`.

Code object V2 metadata is specified by the ``NT_AMD_AMDGPU_METADATA`` note
record (see :ref:`amdgpu-note-records-v2`).

The metadata is specified as a YAML formatted string (see [YAML]_ and
:doc:`YamlIO`).

.. TODO::

  Is the string null terminated? It probably should not if YAML allows it to
  contain null characters, otherwise it should be.

The metadata is represented as a single YAML document comprised of the mapping
defined in table :ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-code-object-metadata-map-table-v2` and
referenced tables.

For boolean values, the string values of ``false`` and ``true`` are used for
false and true respectively.

Additional information can be added to the mappings. To avoid conflicts, any
non-AMD key names should be prefixed by "*vendor-name*.".

Code Object V3 Metadata (-mattr=+code-object-v3)
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Code object V3 metadata is specified by the ``NT_AMDGPU_METADATA`` note record
(see :ref:`amdgpu-note-records-v3`).

The metadata is represented as Message Pack formatted binary data (see
[MsgPack]_). The top level is a Message Pack map that includes the
keys defined in table
:ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-code-object-metadata-map-table-v3` and referenced
tables.

Additional information can be added to the maps. To avoid conflicts,
any key names should be prefixed by "*vendor-name*." where
``vendor-name`` can be the name of the vendor and specific vendor
tool that generates the information. The prefix is abbreviated to
simply "." when it appears within a map that has been added by the
same *vendor-name*.

Kernel Dispatch
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The HSA architected queuing language (AQL) defines a user space memory
interface that can be used to control the dispatch of kernels, in an agent
independent way. An agent can have zero or more AQL queues created for it using
the ROCm runtime, in which AQL packets (all of which are 64 bytes) can be
placed. See the *HSA Platform System Architecture Specification* [HSA]_ for the
AQL queue mechanics and packet layouts.

The packet processor of a kernel agent is responsible for detecting and
dispatching HSA kernels from the AQL queues associated with it. For AMD GPUs the
packet processor is implemented by the hardware command processor (CP),
asynchronous dispatch controller (ADC) and shader processor input controller
(SPI).

The ROCm runtime can be used to allocate an AQL queue object. It uses the kernel
mode driver to initialize and register the AQL queue with CP.

To dispatch a kernel the following actions are performed. This can occur in the
CPU host program, or from an HSA kernel executing on a GPU.

1. A pointer to an AQL queue for the kernel agent on which the kernel is to be
   executed is obtained.
2. A pointer to the kernel descriptor (see
   :ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-kernel-descriptor`) of the kernel to execute is obtained.
   It must be for a kernel that is contained in a code object that that was
   loaded by the ROCm runtime on the kernel agent with which the AQL queue is
   associated.
3. Space is allocated for the kernel arguments using the ROCm runtime allocator
   for a memory region with the kernarg property for the kernel agent that will
   execute the kernel. It must be at least 16 byte aligned.
4. Kernel argument values are assigned to the kernel argument memory
   allocation. The layout is defined in the *HSA Programmer's Language
   Reference* [HSA]_. For AMDGPU the kernel execution directly accesses the
   kernel argument memory in the same way constant memory is accessed. (Note
   that the HSA specification allows an implementation to copy the kernel
   argument contents to another location that is accessed by the kernel.)
5. An AQL kernel dispatch packet is created on the AQL queue. The ROCm runtime
   api uses 64-bit atomic operations to reserve space in the AQL queue for the
   packet. The packet must be set up, and the final write must use an atomic
   store release to set the packet kind to ensure the packet contents are
   visible to the kernel agent. AQL defines a doorbell signal mechanism to
   notify the kernel agent that the AQL queue has been updated. These rules, and
   the layout of the AQL queue and kernel dispatch packet is defined in the *HSA
   System Architecture Specification* [HSA]_.
6. A kernel dispatch packet includes information about the actual dispatch,
   such as grid and work-group size, together with information from the code
   object about the kernel, such as segment sizes. The ROCm runtime queries on
   the kernel symbol can be used to obtain the code object values which are
   recorded in the :ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-code-object-metadata`.
7. CP executes micro-code and is responsible for detecting and setting up the
   GPU to execute the wavefronts of a kernel dispatch.
8. CP ensures that when the a wavefront starts executing the kernel machine
   code, the scalar general purpose registers (SGPR) and vector general purpose
   registers (VGPR) are set up as required by the machine code. The required
   setup is defined in the :ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-kernel-descriptor`. The initial
   register state is defined in
   :ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-initial-kernel-execution-state`.
9. The prolog of the kernel machine code (see
   :ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-kernel-prolog`) sets up the machine state as necessary
   before continuing executing the machine code that corresponds to the kernel.
10. When the kernel dispatch has completed execution, CP signals the completion
    signal specified in the kernel dispatch packet if not 0.

Image and Samplers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Image and sample handles created by the ROCm runtime are 64-bit addresses of a
hardware 32 byte V# and 48 byte S# object respectively. In order to support the
HSA ``query_sampler`` operations two extra dwords are used to store the HSA BRIG
enumeration values for the queries that are not trivially deducible from the S#
representation.

HSA Signals
~~~~~~~~~~~

HSA signal handles created by the ROCm runtime are 64-bit addresses of a
structure allocated in memory accessible from both the CPU and GPU. The
structure is defined by the ROCm runtime and subject to change between releases
(see [AMD-ROCm-github]_).

.. _amdgpu-amdhsa-hsa-aql-queue:

HSA AQL Queue
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The HSA AQL queue structure is defined by the ROCm runtime and subject to change
between releases (see [AMD-ROCm-github]_). For some processors it contains
fields needed to implement certain language features such as the flat address
aperture bases. It also contains fields used by CP such as managing the
allocation of scratch memory.

.. _amdgpu-amdhsa-kernel-descriptor:

Kernel Descriptor
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A kernel descriptor consists of the information needed by CP to initiate the
execution of a kernel, including the entry point address of the machine code
that implements the kernel.

Initial Kernel Execution State
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This section defines the register state that will be set up by the packet
processor prior to the start of execution of every wavefront. This is limited by
the constraints of the hardware controllers of CP/ADC/SPI.

The order of the SGPR registers is defined, but the compiler can specify which
ones are actually setup in the kernel descriptor using the ``enable_sgpr_*`` bit
fields (see :ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-kernel-descriptor`). The register numbers used
for enabled registers are dense starting at SGPR0: the first enabled register is
SGPR0, the next enabled register is SGPR1 etc.; disabled registers do not have
an SGPR number.

The initial SGPRs comprise up to 16 User SRGPs that are set by CP and apply to
all wavefronts of the grid. It is possible to specify more than 16 User SGPRs
using the ``enable_sgpr_*`` bit fields, in which case only the first 16 are
actually initialized. These are then immediately followed by the System SGPRs
that are set up by ADC/SPI and can have different values for each wavefront of
the grid dispatch.

SGPR register initial state is defined in
:ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-sgpr-register-set-up-order-table`.

                _segment_buffer)                  as an offset, to access the
                                                  private address space using a
                                                  segment address.

                                                  CP uses the value provided by
                                                  the runtime.

                                                  queued.
     then       Kernarg Segment Ptr        2      64-bit address of Kernarg

                                                  Having CP load it once avoids
                                                  loading it at the beginning of
                                                  every wavefront.

The order of the VGPR registers is defined, but the compiler can specify which
ones are actually setup in the kernel descriptor using the ``enable_vgpr*`` bit
fields (see :ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-kernel-descriptor`). The register numbers used
for enabled registers are dense starting at VGPR0: the first enabled register is
VGPR0, the next enabled register is VGPR1 etc.; disabled registers do not have a
VGPR number.

     ========== ========================== ====== ==============================

The setting of registers is done by GPU CP/ADC/SPI hardware as follows:

1. SGPRs before the Work-Group Ids are set by CP using the 16 User Data
   registers.
2. Work-group Id registers X, Y, Z are set by ADC which supports any
   combination including none.
3. Scratch Wavefront Offset is set by SPI in a per wavefront basis which is why
   its value cannot included with the flat scratch init value which is per
   queue.
4. The VGPRs are set by SPI which only supports specifying either (X), (X, Y)
   or (X, Y, Z).

Flat Scratch register pair are adjacent SGRRs so they can be moved as a 64-bit
value to the hardware required SGPRn-3 and SGPRn-4 respectively.

The global segment can be accessed either using buffer instructions (GFX6 which
has V# 64-bit address support), flat instructions (GFX7-GFX10), or global
instructions (GFX9-GFX10).

If buffer operations are used then the compiler can generate a V# with the
following properties:

* base address of 0
* no swizzle
* ATC: 1 if IOMMU present (such as APU)
* ptr64: 1
* MTYPE set to support memory coherence that matches the runtime (such as CC for
  APU and NC for dGPU).

M0
++

GFX6-GFX8
  The M0 register must be initialized with a value at least the total LDS size
  if the kernel may access LDS via DS or flat operations. Total LDS size is
  available in dispatch packet. For M0, it is also possible to use maximum
  possible value of LDS for given target (0x7FFF for GFX6 and 0xFFFF for
  GFX7-GFX8).
GFX9-GFX10
  The M0 register is not used for range checking LDS accesses and so does not
  need to be initialized in the prolog.

.. _amdgpu-amdhsa-flat-scratch:

Flat Scratch
++++++++++++

If the kernel may use flat operations to access scratch memory, the prolog code
must set up FLAT_SCRATCH register pair (FLAT_SCRATCH_LO/FLAT_SCRATCH_HI which
are in SGPRn-4/SGPRn-3). Initialization uses Flat Scratch Init and Scratch
Wavefront Offset SGPR registers (see
:ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-initial-kernel-execution-state`):

GFX6
  Flat scratch is not supported.

GFX7-GFX8

  1. The low word of Flat Scratch Init is 32-bit byte offset from
     ``SH_HIDDEN_PRIVATE_BASE_VIMID`` to the base of scratch backing memory
     being managed by SPI for the queue executing the kernel dispatch. This is
     the same value used in the Scratch Segment Buffer V# base address. The
     prolog must add the value of Scratch Wavefront Offset to get the
     wavefront's byte scratch backing memory offset from
     ``SH_HIDDEN_PRIVATE_BASE_VIMID``. Since FLAT_SCRATCH_LO is in units of 256
     bytes, the offset must be right shifted by 8 before moving into
     FLAT_SCRATCH_LO.
  2. The second word of Flat Scratch Init is 32-bit byte size of a single
     work-items scratch memory usage. This is directly loaded from the kernel
     dispatch packet Private Segment Byte Size and rounded up to a multiple of
     DWORD. Having CP load it once avoids loading it at the beginning of every
     wavefront. The prolog must move it to FLAT_SCRATCH_LO for use as FLAT
     SCRATCH SIZE.

GFX9-GFX10
  The Flat Scratch Init is the 64-bit address of the base of scratch backing
  memory being managed by SPI for the queue executing the kernel dispatch. The
  prolog must add the value of Scratch Wavefront Offset and moved to the
  FLAT_SCRATCH pair for use as the flat scratch base in flat memory
  instructions.

.. _amdgpu-amdhsa-memory-model:

Memory Model
~~~~~~~~~~~~

This section describes the mapping of LLVM memory model onto AMDGPU machine code
(see :ref:`memmodel`).

The AMDGPU backend supports the memory synchronization scopes specified in
:ref:`amdgpu-memory-scopes`.

The code sequences used to implement the memory model are defined in table
:ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-memory-model-code-sequences-gfx6-gfx10-table`.

The sequences specify the order of instructions that a single thread must
execute. The ``s_waitcnt`` and ``buffer_wbinvl1_vol`` are defined with respect
to other memory instructions executed by the same thread. This allows them to be
moved earlier or later which can allow them to be combined with other instances
of the same instruction, or hoisted/sunk out of loops to improve
performance. Only the instructions related to the memory model are given;
additional ``s_waitcnt`` instructions are required to ensure registers are
defined before being used. These may be able to be combined with the memory
model ``s_waitcnt`` instructions as described above.

The AMDGPU backend supports the following memory models:

  HSA Memory Model [HSA]_
    The HSA memory model uses a single happens-before relation for all address
    spaces (see :ref:`amdgpu-address-spaces`).
  OpenCL Memory Model [OpenCL]_
    The OpenCL memory model which has separate happens-before relations for the
    global and local address spaces. Only a fence specifying both global and
    local address space, and seq_cst instructions join the relationships. Since
    the LLVM ``memfence`` instruction does not allow an address space to be
    specified the OpenCL fence has to conservatively assume both local and
    global address space was specified. However, optimizations can often be
    done to eliminate the additional ``s_waitcnt`` instructions when there are
    no intervening memory instructions which access the corresponding address
    space. The code sequences in the table indicate what can be omitted for the
    OpenCL memory. The target triple environment is used to determine if the
    source language is OpenCL (see :ref:`amdgpu-opencl`).

``ds/flat_load/store/atomic`` instructions to local memory are termed LDS
operations.

``buffer/global/flat_load/store/atomic`` instructions to global memory are
termed vector memory operations.

For GFX6-GFX9:

* Each agent has multiple shader arrays (SA).
* Each SA has multiple compute units (CU).
* Each CU has multiple SIMDs that execute wavefronts.
* The wavefronts for a single work-group are executed in the same CU but may be
  executed by different SIMDs.
* Each CU has a single LDS memory shared by the wavefronts of the work-groups
  executing on it.
* All LDS operations of a CU are performed as wavefront wide operations in a
  global order and involve no caching. Completion is reported to a wavefront in
  execution order.
* The LDS memory has multiple request queues shared by the SIMDs of a
  CU. Therefore, the LDS operations performed by different wavefronts of a
  work-group can be reordered relative to each other, which can result in
  reordering the visibility of vector memory operations with respect to LDS
  operations of other wavefronts in the same work-group. A ``s_waitcnt
  lgkmcnt(0)`` is required to ensure synchronization between LDS operations and
  vector memory operations between wavefronts of a work-group, but not between
  operations performed by the same wavefront.
* The vector memory operations are performed as wavefront wide operations and
  completion is reported to a wavefront in execution order. The exception is
  that for GFX7-GFX9 ``flat_load/store/atomic`` instructions can report out of
  vector memory order if they access LDS memory, and out of LDS operation order
  if they access global memory.
* The vector memory operations access a single vector L1 cache shared by all
  SIMDs a CU. Therefore, no special action is required for coherence between the
  lanes of a single wavefront, or for coherence between wavefronts in the same
  work-group. A ``buffer_wbinvl1_vol`` is required for coherence between
  wavefronts executing in different work-groups as they may be executing on
  different CUs.
* The scalar memory operations access a scalar L1 cache shared by all wavefronts
  on a group of CUs. The scalar and vector L1 caches are not coherent. However,
  scalar operations are used in a restricted way so do not impact the memory
  model. See :ref:`amdgpu-address-spaces`.
* The vector and scalar memory operations use an L2 cache shared by all CUs on
  the same agent.
* The L2 cache has independent channels to service disjoint ranges of virtual
  addresses.
* Each CU has a separate request queue per channel. Therefore, the vector and
  scalar memory operations performed by wavefronts executing in different
  work-groups (which may be executing on different CUs) of an agent can be
  reordered relative to each other. A ``s_waitcnt vmcnt(0)`` is required to
  ensure synchronization between vector memory operations of different CUs. It
  ensures a previous vector memory operation has completed before executing a
  subsequent vector memory or LDS operation and so can be used to meet the
  requirements of acquire and release.
* The L2 cache can be kept coherent with other agents on some targets, or ranges
  of virtual addresses can be set up to bypass it to ensure system coherence.

For GFX10:

* Each agent has multiple shader arrays (SA).
* Each SA has multiple work-group processors (WGP).
* Each WGP has multiple compute units (CU).
* Each CU has multiple SIMDs that execute wavefronts.
* The wavefronts for a single work-group are executed in the same
  WGP. In CU wavefront execution mode the wavefronts may be executed by
  different SIMDs in the same CU. In WGP wavefront execution mode the
  wavefronts may be executed by different SIMDs in different CUs in the same
  WGP.
* Each WGP has a single LDS memory shared by the wavefronts of the work-groups
  executing on it.
* All LDS operations of a WGP are performed as wavefront wide operations in a
  global order and involve no caching. Completion is reported to a wavefront in
  execution order.
* The LDS memory has multiple request queues shared by the SIMDs of a
  WGP. Therefore, the LDS operations performed by different wavefronts of a
  work-group can be reordered relative to each other, which can result in
  reordering the visibility of vector memory operations with respect to LDS
  operations of other wavefronts in the same work-group. A ``s_waitcnt
  lgkmcnt(0)`` is required to ensure synchronization between LDS operations and
  vector memory operations between wavefronts of a work-group, but not between
  operations performed by the same wavefront.
* The vector memory operations are performed as wavefront wide operations.
  Completion of load/store/sample operations are reported to a wavefront in
  execution order of other load/store/sample operations performed by that
  wavefront.
* The vector memory operations access a vector L0 cache. There is a single L0
  cache per CU. Each SIMD of a CU accesses the same L0 cache. Therefore, no
  special action is required for coherence between the lanes of a single
  wavefront. However, a ``BUFFER_GL0_INV`` is required for coherence between
  wavefronts executing in the same work-group as they may be executing on SIMDs
  of different CUs that access different L0s. A ``BUFFER_GL0_INV`` is also
  required for coherence between wavefronts executing in different work-groups
  as they may be executing on different WGPs.
* The scalar memory operations access a scalar L0 cache shared by all wavefronts
  on a WGP. The scalar and vector L0 caches are not coherent. However, scalar
  operations are used in a restricted way so do not impact the memory model. See
  :ref:`amdgpu-address-spaces`.
* The vector and scalar memory L0 caches use an L1 cache shared by all WGPs on
  the same SA. Therefore, no special action is required for coherence between
  the wavefronts of a single work-group. However, a ``BUFFER_GL1_INV`` is
  required for coherence between wavefronts executing in different work-groups
  as they may be executing on different SAs that access different L1s.
* The L1 caches have independent quadrants to service disjoint ranges of virtual
  addresses.
* Each L0 cache has a separate request queue per L1 quadrant. Therefore, the
  vector and scalar memory operations performed by different wavefronts, whether
  executing in the same or different work-groups (which may be executing on
  different CUs accessing different L0s), can be reordered relative to each
  other. A ``s_waitcnt vmcnt(0) & vscnt(0)`` is required to ensure
  synchronization between vector memory operations of different wavefronts. It
  ensures a previous vector memory operation has completed before executing a
  subsequent vector memory or LDS operation and so can be used to meet the
  requirements of acquire, release and sequential consistency.
* The L1 caches use an L2 cache shared by all SAs on the same agent.
* The L2 cache has independent channels to service disjoint ranges of virtual
  addresses.
* Each L1 quadrant of a single SA accesses a different L2 channel. Each L1
  quadrant has a separate request queue per L2 channel. Therefore, the vector
  and scalar memory operations performed by wavefronts executing in different
  work-groups (which may be executing on different SAs) of an agent can be
  reordered relative to each other. A ``s_waitcnt vmcnt(0) & vscnt(0)`` is
  required to ensure synchronization between vector memory operations of
  different SAs. It ensures a previous vector memory operation has completed
  before executing a subsequent vector memory and so can be used to meet the
  requirements of acquire, release and sequential consistency.
* The L2 cache can be kept coherent with other agents on some targets, or ranges
  of virtual addresses can be set up to bypass it to ensure system coherence.

Private address space uses ``buffer_load/store`` using the scratch V#
(GFX6-GFX8), or ``scratch_load/store`` (GFX9-GFX10). Since only a single thread
is accessing the memory, atomic memory orderings are not meaningful and all
accesses are treated as non-atomic.

Constant address space uses ``buffer/global_load`` instructions (or equivalent
scalar memory instructions). Since the constant address space contents do not
change during the execution of a kernel dispatch it is not legal to perform
stores, and atomic memory orderings are not meaningful and all access are
treated as non-atomic.

A memory synchronization scope wider than work-group is not meaningful for the
group (LDS) address space and is treated as work-group.

The memory model does not support the region address space which is treated as
non-atomic.

Acquire memory ordering is not meaningful on store atomic instructions and is
treated as non-atomic.

Release memory ordering is not meaningful on load atomic instructions and is
treated a non-atomic.

Acquire-release memory ordering is not meaningful on load or store atomic
instructions and is treated as acquire and release respectively.

AMDGPU backend only uses scalar memory operations to access memory that is
proven to not change during the execution of the kernel dispatch. This includes
constant address space and global address space for program scope const
variables. Therefore the kernel machine code does not have to maintain the
scalar L1 cache to ensure it is coherent with the vector L1 cache. The scalar
and vector L1 caches are invalidated between kernel dispatches by CP since
constant address space data may change between kernel dispatch executions. See
:ref:`amdgpu-address-spaces`.

The one exception is if scalar writes are used to spill SGPR registers. In this
case the AMDGPU backend ensures the memory location used to spill is never
accessed by vector memory operations at the same time. If scalar writes are used
then a ``s_dcache_wb`` is inserted before the ``s_endpgm`` and before a function
return since the locations may be used for vector memory instructions by a
future wavefront that uses the same scratch area, or a function call that
creates a frame at the same address, respectively. There is no need for a
``s_dcache_inv`` as all scalar writes are write-before-read in the same thread.

For GFX6-GFX9, scratch backing memory (which is used for the private address
space) is accessed with MTYPE NC_NV (non-coherent non-volatile). Since the
private address space is only accessed by a single thread, and is always
write-before-read, there is never a need to invalidate these entries from the L1
cache. Hence all cache invalidates are done as ``*_vol`` to only invalidate the
volatile cache lines.

For GFX10, scratch backing memory (which is used for the private address space)
is accessed with MTYPE NC (non-coherent). Since the private address space is
only accessed by a single thread, and is always write-before-read, there is
never a need to invalidate these entries from the L0 or L1 caches.

For GFX10, wavefronts are executed in native mode with in-order reporting of
loads and sample instructions. In this mode vmcnt reports completion of load,
atomic with return and sample instructions in order, and the vscnt reports the
completion of store and atomic without return in order. See ``MEM_ORDERED``
field in :ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-compute_pgm_rsrc1-gfx6-gfx10-table`.

In GFX10, wavefronts can be executed in WGP or CU wavefront execution mode:

* In WGP wavefront execution mode the wavefronts of a work-group are executed
  on the SIMDs of both CUs of the WGP. Therefore, explicit management of the per
  CU L0 caches is required for work-group synchronization. Also accesses to L1
  at work-group scope need to be explicitly ordered as the accesses from
  different CUs are not ordered.
* In CU wavefront execution mode the wavefronts of a work-group are executed on
  the SIMDs of a single CU of the WGP. Therefore, all global memory access by
  the work-group access the same L0 which in turn ensures L1 accesses are
  ordered and so do not require explicit management of the caches for
  work-group synchronization.

See ``WGP_MODE`` field in
:ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-compute_pgm_rsrc1-gfx6-gfx10-table` and
:ref:`amdgpu-target-features`.

On dGPU the kernarg backing memory is accessed as UC (uncached) to avoid needing
to invalidate the L2 cache. For GFX6-GFX9, this also causes it to be treated as
non-volatile and so is not invalidated by ``*_vol``. On APU it is accessed as CC
(cache coherent) and so the L2 cache will be coherent with the CPU and other
agents.

Trap Handler ABI
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For code objects generated by AMDGPU backend for HSA [HSA]_ compatible runtimes
(such as ROCm [AMD-ROCm]_), the runtime installs a trap handler that supports
the ``s_trap`` instruction with the following usage:

Call Convention
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note::

  This section is currently incomplete and has inakkuracies. It is WIP that will
  be updated as information is determined.

See :ref:`amdgpu-dwarf-address-space-mapping` for information on swizzled
addresses. Unswizzled addresses are normal linear addresses.

Kernel Functions
++++++++++++++++

This section describes the call convention ABI for the outer kernel function.

See :ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-initial-kernel-execution-state` for the kernel call
convention.

The following is not part of the AMDGPU kernel calling convention but describes
how the AMDGPU implements function calls:

1.  Clang decides the kernarg layout to match the *HSA Programmer's Language
    Reference* [HSA]_.

    - All structs are passed directly.
    - Lambda values are passed *TBA*.

    .. TODO::

      - Does this really follow HSA rules? Or are structs >16 bytes passed
        by-value struct?
      - What is ABI for lambda values?

2.  The CFI return address is undefined.
3.  If the kernel contains no calls then:

    - If using the ``amdhsa`` OS ABI (see :ref:`amdgpu-os-table`), and know
      during ISel that there is stack usage SGPR0-3 is reserved for use as the
      scratch SRD and SGPR33 reserved for the wave scratch offset. Stack usage
      is assumed if ``-O0``, if already aware of stack objects for locals, etc.,
      or if there are any function calls.
    - Otherwise, five high numbered SGPRs are reserved for the tentative scratch
      SRD and wave scratch offset. These will be used if determine need to do
      spilling.

      - If no use is made of the tentative scratch SRD or wave scratch offset,
        then they are unreserved and the register count is determined ignoring
        them.
      - If use is made of the tenatative scratch SRD or wave scratch offset,
        then the register numbers used are shifted to be after the highest one
        allocated by the register allocator, and all uses updated. The register
        count will include them in the shifted location. Since register
        allocation may introduce spills, this shifting allows them to be
        eliminated without having to perform register allocation again.
      - In either case, if the processor has the SGPR allocation bug, the
        tentative allocation is not shifted or unreserved inorder to ensure the
        register count is higher to workaround the bug.

4.  If the kernel contains function calls:

    - SP is set to the wave scratch offset.

      - Since SP is an unswizzled address relative to the queue scratch base, an
        wave scratch offset is an unswizzle offset, this means that if SP is
        used to access swizzled scratch memory, it will access the private
        segment address 0.

      .. note::

        This is planned to be changed to be the unswizzled base address of the
        wavefront scratch backing memory.

Non-Kernel Functions
++++++++++++++++++++

This section describes the call convention ABI for functions other than the
outer kernel function.

If a kernel has function calls then scratch is always allocated and used for the
call stack which grows from low address to high address using the swizzled
scratch address space.

On entry to a function:

1.  SGPR0-3 contain a V# with the following properties:

    * Base address of the queue scratch backing memory.

      .. note::

        This is planned to be changed to be the unswizzled base address of the
        wavefront scratch backing memory.

    * Swizzled with dword element size and stride of wavefront size elements.

2.  The FLAT_SCRATCH register pair is setup. See
    :ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-flat-scratch`.
3.  GFX6-8: M0 register set to the size of LDS in bytes.
4.  The EXEC register is set to the lanes active on entry to the function.
5.  MODE register: *TBD*
6.  VGPR0-31 and SGPR4-29 are used to pass function input arguments as described
    below.
7.  SGPR30-31 return address (RA). The code address that the function must
    return to when it completes. The value is undefined if the function is *no
    return*.
8.  SGPR32 is used for the stack pointer (SP). It is an unswizzled
    scratch offset relative to the beginning of the queue scratch backing
    memory.

    The unswizzled SP can be used with buffer instructions as an unswizzled SGPR
    offset with the scratch V# in SGPR0-3 to access the stack in a swizzled
    manner.

    The swizzled SP value is always 4 bytes aligned for the ``r600``
    architecture and 16 byte aligned for the ``amdgcn`` architecture.

    .. note::

      The ``amdgcn`` value is selected to avoid dynamic stack alignment for the
      OpenCL language which has the largest base type defined as 16 bytes.

    On entry, the swizzled SP value is the address of the first function
    argument passed on the stack. Other stack passed arguments are positive
    offsets from the entry swizzled SP value.

    The function may use positive offsets beyond the last stack passed argument
    for stack allocated local variables and register spill slots. If necessary
    the function may align these to greater alignment than 16 bytes. After these
    the function may dynamically allocate space for such things as runtime sized
    ``alloca`` local allocations.

    If the function calls another function, it will place any stack allocated
    arguments after the last local allocation and adjust SGPR32 to the address
    after the last local allocation.

    .. note::

      The SP value is planned to be changed to be the unswizzled offset relative
      to the wavefront scratch backing memory.

9.  SGPR33 wavefront scratch base offset. The unswizzled offset from the queue
    scratch backing memory base to the base of the wavefront scratch backing
    memory.

    It is used to convert the unswizzled SP value to swizzled address in the
    private address space by:

      | private address = (unswizzled SP - wavefront scratch base offset) /
        wavefront size

    This may be used to obtain the private address of stack objects and to
    convert these address to a flat address by adding the flat scratch aperture
    base address.

    .. note::

      This is planned to be eliminated when SP is changed to be the unswizzled
      offset relative to the wavefront scratch backing memory. The the
      conversion simplifies to:

        | private address = unswizzled SP / wavefront size

10. All other registers are unspecified.
11. Any necessary ``waitcnt`` has been performed to ensure memory is available
    to the function.

On exit from a function:

1.  VGPR0-31 and SGPR4-29 are used to pass function result arguments as
    described below. Any registers used are considered clobbered registers,
2.  The following registers are preserved and have the same value as on entry:

    * FLAT_SCRATCH
    * EXEC
    * GFX6-8: M0
    * All SGPR and VGPR registers except the clobbered registers of SGPR4-31 and
      VGPR0-31.

      For the AMDGPU backend, an inter-procedural register allocation (IPRA)
      optimization may mark some of clobbered SGPR4-31 and VGPR0-31 registers as
      preserved if it can be determined that the called function does not change
      their value.

2.  The PC is set to the RA provided on entry.
3.  MODE register: *TBD*.
4.  All other registers are clobbered.
5.  Any necessary ``waitcnt`` has been performed to ensure memory accessed by
    function is available to the caller.

.. TODO::

  - On gfx908 are all ACC registers clobbered?

  - How are function results returned? The address of structured types is passed
    by reference, but what about other types?

The function input arguments are made up of the formal arguments explicitly
declared by the source language function plus the implicit input arguments used
by the implementation.

The source language input arguments are:

1. Any source language implicit ``this`` or ``self`` argument comes first as a
   pointer type.
2. Followed by the function formal arguments in left to right source order.

The source language result arguments are:

1. The function result argument.

The source language input or result struct type arguments that are less than or
equal to 16 bytes, are decomposed recursively into their base type fields, and
each field is passed as if a separate argument. For input arguments, if the
called function requires the struct to be in memory, for example because its
address is taken, then the function body is responsible for allocating a stack
location and copying the field arguments into it. Clang terms this *direct
struct*.

The source language input struct type arguments that are greater than 16 bytes,
are passed by reference. The caller is responsible for allocating a stack
location to make a copy of the struct value and pass the address as the input
argument. The called function is responsible to perform the dereference when
accessing the input argument. Clang terms this *by-value struct*.

A source language result struct type argument that is greater than 16 bytes, is
returned by reference. The caller is responsible for allocating a stack location
to hold the result value and passes the address as the last input argument
(before the implicit input arguments). In this case there are no result
arguments. The called function is responsible to perform the dereference when
storing the result value. Clang terms this *structured return (sret)*.

*TODO: correct the sret definition.*

.. TODO::

  Is this definition correct? Or is sret only used if passing in registers, and
  pass as non-decomposed struct as stack argument? Or something else? Is the
  memory location in the caller stack frame, or a stack memory argument and so
  no address is passed as the caller can directly write to the argument stack
  location. But then the stack location is still live after return. If an
  argument stack location is it the first stack argument or the last one?

Lambda argument types are treated as struct types with an implementation defined
set of fields.

.. TODO::

  Need to specify the ABI for lambda types for AMDGPU.

For AMDGPU backend all source language arguments (including the decomposed
struct type arguments) are passed in VGPRs unless marked ``inreg`` in which case
they are passed in SGPRs.

The AMDGPU backend walks the function call graph from the leaves to determine
which implicit input arguments are used, propagating to each caller of the
function. The used implicit arguments are appended to the function arguments
after the source language arguments in the following order:

.. TODO::

  Is recursion or external functions supported?

1.  Work-Item ID (1 VGPR)

    The X, Y and Z work-item ID are packed into a single VGRP with the following
    layout. Only fields actually used by the function are set. The other bits
    are undefined.

    The values come from the initial kernel execution state. See
    :ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-vgpr-register-set-up-order-table`.

    .. table:: Work-item implict argument layout
      :name: amdgpu-amdhsa-workitem-implict-argument-layout-table

      ======= ======= ==============
      Bits    Size    Field Name
      ======= ======= ==============
      9:0     10 bits X Work-Item ID
      19:10   10 bits Y Work-Item ID
      29:20   10 bits Z Work-Item ID
      31:30   2 bits  Unused
      ======= ======= ==============

2.  Dispatch Ptr (2 SGPRs)

    The value comes from the initial kernel execution state. See
    :ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-sgpr-register-set-up-order-table`.

3.  Queue Ptr (2 SGPRs)

    The value comes from the initial kernel execution state. See
    :ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-sgpr-register-set-up-order-table`.

4.  Kernarg Segment Ptr (2 SGPRs)

    The value comes from the initial kernel execution state. See
    :ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-sgpr-register-set-up-order-table`.

5.  Dispatch id (2 SGPRs)

    The value comes from the initial kernel execution state. See
    :ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-sgpr-register-set-up-order-table`.

6.  Work-Group ID X (1 SGPR)

    The value comes from the initial kernel execution state. See
    :ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-sgpr-register-set-up-order-table`.

7.  Work-Group ID Y (1 SGPR)

    The value comes from the initial kernel execution state. See
    :ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-sgpr-register-set-up-order-table`.

8.  Work-Group ID Z (1 SGPR)

    The value comes from the initial kernel execution state. See
    :ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-sgpr-register-set-up-order-table`.

9.  Implicit Argument Ptr (2 SGPRs)

    The value is computed by adding an offset to Kernarg Segment Ptr to get the
    global address space pointer to the first kernarg implicit argument.

The input and result arguments are assigned in order in the following manner:

..note::

  There are likely some errors and ommissions in the following description that
  need correction.

  ..TODO::

    Check the clang source code to decipher how funtion arguments and return
    results are handled. Also see the AMDGPU specific values used.

* VGPR arguments are assigned to consecutive VGPRs starting at VGPR0 up to
  VGPR31.

  If there are more arguments than will fit in these registers, the remaining
  arguments are allocated on the stack in order on naturally aligned
  addresses.

  .. TODO::

    How are overly aligned structures allocated on the stack?

* SGPR arguments are assigned to consecutive SGPRs starting at SGPR0 up to
  SGPR29.

  If there are more arguments than will fit in these registers, the remaining
  arguments are allocated on the stack in order on naturally aligned
  addresses.

Note that decomposed struct type arguments may have some fields passed in
registers and some in memory.

..TODO::

  So a struct which can pass some fields as decomposed register arguments, will
  pass the rest as decomposed stack elements? But an arguent that will not start
  in registers will not be decomposed and will be passed as a non-decomposed
  stack value?

The following is not part of the AMDGPU function calling convention but
describes how the AMDGPU implements function calls:

1.  SGPR34 is used as a frame pointer (FP) if necessary. Like the SP it is an
    unswizzled scratch address. It is only needed if runtime sized ``alloca``
    are used, or for the reasons defined in ``SiFrameLowering``.
2.  Runtime stack alignment is not currently supported.

    .. TODO::

      - If runtime stack alignment is supported then will an extra argument
        pointer register be used?

2.  Allocating SGPR arguments on the stack are not supported.

3.  No CFI is currently generated. See :ref:`amdgpu-call-frame-information`.

    ..note::

      Before CFI is generated, the call convention will be changed so that SP is
      an unswizzled address relative to the wave scratch base.

      CFI will be generated that defines the CFA as the unswizzled address
      relative to the wave scratch base in the unswizzled private address space
      of the lowest address stack allocated local variable.

      ``DW_AT_frame_base`` will be defined as the swizelled address in the
      swizzled private address space by dividing the CFA by the wavefront size
      (since CFA is always at least dword aligned which matches the scratch
      swizzle element size).

      If no dynamic stack alignment was performed, the stack allocated arguments
      are accessed as negative offsets relative to ``DW_AT_frame_base``, and the
      local variables and register spill slots are accessed as positive offsets
      relative to ``DW_AT_frame_base``.

4.  Function argument passing is implemented by copying the input physical
    registers to virtual registers on entry. The register allocator can spill if
    necessary. These are copied back to physical registers at call sites. The
    net effect is that each function call can have these values in entirely
    distinct locations. The IPRA can help avoid shuffling argument registers.
5.  Call sites are implemented by setting up the arguments at positive offsets
    from SP. Then SP is incremented to account for the known frame size before
    the call and decremented after the call.

    ..note::

      The CFI will reflect the changed calculation needed to compute the CFA
      from SP.

6.  4 byte spill slots are used in the stack frame. One slot is allocated for an
    emergency spill slot. Buffer instructions are used for stack accesses and
    not the ``flat_scratch`` instruction.

    ..TODO::

      Explain when the emergency spill slot is used.

.. TODO::

  Possible broken issues:

  - Stack arguments must be aligned to required alignment.
  - Stack is aligned to max(16, max formal argument alignment)
  - Direct argument < 64 bits should check register budget.
  - Register budget calculation should respect ``inreg`` for SGPR.
  - SGPR overflow is not handled.
  - struct with 1 member unpeeling is not checking size of member.
  - ``sret`` is after ``this`` pointer.
  - Caller is not implementing stack realignment: need an extra pointer.
  - Should say AMDGPU passes FP rather than SP.
  - Should CFI define CFA as address of locals or arguments. Difference is
    apparent when have implemented dynamic alignment.
  - If ``SCRATCH`` instruction could allow negative offsets then can make FP be
    highest address of stack frame and use negative offset for locals. Would
    allow SP to be the same as FP and could support signal-handler-like as now
    have a real SP for the top of the stack.
  - How is ``sret`` passed on the stack? In argument stack area? Can it overlay
    arguments?

AMDPAL
------

This section provides code conventions used when the target triple OS is
``amdpal`` (see :ref:`amdgpu-target-triples`) for passing runtime parameters
from the application/runtime to each invocation of a hardware shader. These
parameters include both generic, application-controlled parameters called
*user data* as well as system-generated parameters that are a product of the
draw or dispatch execution.

User Data
~~~~~~~~~

Each hardware stage has a set of 32-bit *user data registers* which can be
written from a command buffer and then loaded into SGPRs when waves are launched
via a subsequent dispatch or draw operation. This is the way most arguments are
passed from the application/runtime to a hardware shader.

Compute User Data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Compute shader user data mappings are simpler than graphics shaders, and have a
fixed mapping.

Note that there are always 10 available *user data entries* in registers -
entries beyond that limit must be fetched from memory (via the spill table
pointer) by the shader.

  .. table:: PAL Compute Shader User Data Registers
     :name: pal-compute-user-data-registers

     ============= ================================
     User Register Description
     ============= ================================
     0             Global Internal Table (32-bit pointer)
     1             Per-Shader Internal Table (32-bit pointer)
     2 - 11        Application-Controlled User Data (10 32-bit values)
     12            Spill Table (32-bit pointer)
     13 - 14       Thread Group Count (64-bit pointer)
     15            GDS Range
     ============= ================================

Graphics User Data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Graphics pipelines support a much more flexible user data mapping:

  .. table:: PAL Graphics Shader User Data Registers
     :name: pal-graphics-user-data-registers

     ============= ================================
     User Register Description
     ============= ================================
     0             Global Internal Table (32-bit pointer)
     +             Per-Shader Internal Table (32-bit pointer)
     + 1-15        Application Controlled User Data
                   (1-15 Contiguous 32-bit Values in Registers)
     +             Spill Table (32-bit pointer)
     +             Draw Index (First Stage Only)
     +             Vertex Offset (First Stage Only)
     +             Instance Offset (First Stage Only)
     ============= ================================

  The placement of the global internal table remains fixed in the first *user
  data SGPR register*. Otherwise all parameters are optional, and can be mapped
  to any desired *user data SGPR register*, with the following restrictions:

  * Draw Index, Vertex Offset, and Instance Offset can only be used by the first
    active hardware stage in a graphics pipeline (i.e. where the API vertex
    shader runs).

  * Application-controlled user data must be mapped into a contiguous range of
    user data registers.

  * The application-controlled user data range supports compaction remapping, so
    only *entries* that are actually consumed by the shader must be assigned to
    corresponding *registers*. Note that in order to support an efficient runtime
    implementation, the remapping must pack *registers* in the same order as
    *entries*, with unused *entries* removed.

.. _pal_global_internal_table:

Global Internal Table
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The global internal table is a table of *shader resource descriptors* (SRDs)
that define how certain engine-wide, runtime-managed resources should be
accessed from a shader. The majority of these resources have HW-defined formats,
and it is up to the compiler to write/read data as required by the target
hardware.

The following table illustrates the required format:

  .. table:: PAL Global Internal Table
     :name: pal-git-table

     ============= ================================
     Offset        Description
     ============= ================================
     0-3           Graphics Scratch SRD
     4-7           Compute Scratch SRD
     8-11          ES/GS Ring Output SRD
     12-15         ES/GS Ring Input SRD
     16-19         GS/VS Ring Output #0
     20-23         GS/VS Ring Output #1
     24-27         GS/VS Ring Output #2
     28-31         GS/VS Ring Output #3
     32-35         GS/VS Ring Input SRD
     36-39         Tessellation Factor Buffer SRD
     40-43         Off-Chip LDS Buffer SRD
     44-47         Off-Chip Param Cache Buffer SRD
     48-51         Sample Position Buffer SRD
     52            vaRange::ShadowDescriptorTable High Bits
     ============= ================================

  The pointer to the global internal table passed to the shader as user data
  is a 32-bit pointer. The top 32 bits should be assumed to be the same as
  the top 32 bits of the pipeline, so the shader may use the program
  counter's top 32 bits.

Unspecified OS
--------------

This section provides code conventions used when the target triple OS is
empty (see :ref:`amdgpu-target-triples`).

Trap Handler ABI
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For code objects generated by AMDGPU backend for non-amdhsa OS, the runtime does
not install a trap handler. The ``llvm.trap`` and ``llvm.debugtrap``
instructions are handled as follows:

  .. table:: AMDGPU Trap Handler for Non-AMDHSA OS
     :name: amdgpu-trap-handler-for-non-amdhsa-os-table

     =============== =============== ===========================================
     Usage           Code Sequence   Description
     =============== =============== ===========================================
     llvm.trap       s_endpgm        Causes wavefront to be terminated.
     llvm.debugtrap  *none*          Compiler warning given that there is no
                                     trap handler installed.
     =============== =============== ===========================================

Source Languages
================

.. _amdgpu-opencl:

OpenCL
------

When the language is OpenCL the following differences occur:

1. The OpenCL memory model is used (see :ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-memory-model`).
2. The AMDGPU backend appends additional arguments to the kernel's explicit

VALU
++++

For vector ALU instruction opcodes (VOP1, VOP2, VOP3, VOPC, VOP_DPP, VOP_SDWA),
the assembler will automatically use optimal encoding based on its operands. To
force specific encoding, one can add a suffix to the opcode of the instruction:

* _e32 for 32-bit VOP1/VOP2/VOPC
* _e64 for 64-bit VOP3
* _dpp for VOP_DPP
* _sdwa for VOP_SDWA

.. _amdgpu-amdhsa-assembler-predefined-symbols-v2:

Code Object V2 Predefined Symbols (-mattr=-code-object-v3)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. warning:: Code Object V2 is not the default code object version emitted by
  this version of LLVM. For a description of the predefined symbols available
  with the default configuration (Code Object V3) see
  :ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-assembler-predefined-symbols-v3`.

The AMDGPU assembler defines and updates some symbols automatically. These
symbols do not affect code generation.

.option.machine_version_major
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Set to the GFX major generation number of the target being assembled for. For
example, when assembling for a "GFX9" target this will be set to the integer
value "9". The possible GFX major generation numbers are presented in
:ref:`amdgpu-processors`.

.option.machine_version_minor
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Set to the GFX minor generation number of the target being assembled for. For
example, when assembling for a "GFX810" target this will be set to the integer
value "1". The possible GFX minor generation numbers are presented in
:ref:`amdgpu-processors`.

.option.machine_version_stepping
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Set to the GFX stepping generation number of the target being assembled for.
For example, when assembling for a "GFX704" target this will be set to the
integer value "4". The possible GFX stepping generation numbers are presented
in :ref:`amdgpu-processors`.

.kernel.vgpr_count
++++++++++++++++++

Set to zero each time a
:ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-assembler-directive-amdgpu_hsa_kernel` directive is
encountered. At each instruction, if the current value of this symbol is less
than or equal to the maximum VPGR number explicitly referenced within that
instruction then the symbol value is updated to equal that VGPR number plus
one.

.kernel.sgpr_count
++++++++++++++++++

Set to zero each time a
:ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-assembler-directive-amdgpu_hsa_kernel` directive is
encountered. At each instruction, if the current value of this symbol is less
than or equal to the maximum VPGR number explicitly referenced within that
instruction then the symbol value is updated to equal that SGPR number plus
one.

.. _amdgpu-amdhsa-assembler-directives-v2:

Code Object V2 Directives (-mattr=-code-object-v3)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. warning:: Code Object V2 is not the default code object version emitted by
  this version of LLVM. For a description of the directives supported with
  the default configuration (Code Object V3) see
  :ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-assembler-directives-v3`.

AMDGPU ABI defines auxiliary data in output code object. In assembly source,
one can specify them with assembler directives.

.hsa_code_object_version major, minor
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

*major* and *minor* are integers that specify the version of the HSA code
object that will be generated by the assembler.

.hsa_code_object_isa [major, minor, stepping, vendor, arch]
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


*major*, *minor*, and *stepping* are all integers that describe the instruction
set architecture (ISA) version of the assembly program.

*vendor* and *arch* are quoted strings. *vendor* should always be equal to
"AMD" and *arch* should always be equal to "AMDGPU".

By default, the assembler will derive the ISA version, *vendor*, and *arch*
from the value of the -mcpu option that is passed to the assembler.

.. _amdgpu-amdhsa-assembler-directive-amdgpu_hsa_kernel:

.amdgpu_hsa_kernel (name)
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

This directives specifies that the symbol with given name is a kernel entry
point (label) and the object should contain corresponding symbol of type
STT_AMDGPU_HSA_KERNEL.

.amd_kernel_code_t
++++++++++++++++++

This directive marks the beginning of a list of key / value pairs that are used
to specify the amd_kernel_code_t object that will be emitted by the assembler.
The list must be terminated by the *.end_amd_kernel_code_t* directive. For any
amd_kernel_code_t values that are unspecified a default value will be used. The
default value for all keys is 0, with the following exceptions:

- *amd_code_version_major* defaults to 1.
- *amd_kernel_code_version_minor* defaults to 2.
- *amd_machine_kind* defaults to 1.
- *amd_machine_version_major*, *machine_version_minor*, and
  *amd_machine_version_stepping* are derived from the value of the -mcpu option
  that is passed to the assembler.
- *kernel_code_entry_byte_offset* defaults to 256.
- *wavefront_size* defaults 6 for all targets before GFX10. For GFX10 onwards
  defaults to 6 if target feature ``wavefrontsize64`` is enabled, otherwise 5.
  Note that wavefront size is specified as a power of two, so a value of **n**
  means a size of 2^ **n**.
- *call_convention* defaults to -1.
- *kernarg_segment_alignment*, *group_segment_alignment*, and
  *private_segment_alignment* default to 4. Note that alignments are specified
  as a power of 2, so a value of **n** means an alignment of 2^ **n**.
- *enable_wgp_mode* defaults to 1 if target feature ``cumode`` is disabled for
  GFX10 onwards.
- *enable_mem_ordered* defaults to 1 for GFX10 onwards.

The *.amd_kernel_code_t* directive must be placed immediately after the
function label and before any instructions.

For a full list of amd_kernel_code_t keys, refer to AMDGPU ABI document,
comments in lib/Target/AMDGPU/AmdKernelCodeT.h and test/CodeGen/AMDGPU/hsa.s.

in :ref:`amdgpu-processors`.

.. _amdgpu-amdhsa-assembler-symbol-next_free_vgpr:

.amdgcn.next_free_vgpr
++++++++++++++++++++++

Set to zero before assembly begins. At each instruction, if the current value
of this symbol is less than or equal to the maximum VGPR number explicitly
referenced within that instruction then the symbol value is updated to equal
that VGPR number plus one.

May be used to set the `.amdhsa_next_free_vpgr` directive in
:ref:`amdhsa-kernel-directives-table`.

May be set at any time, e.g. manually set to zero at the start of each kernel.

.. _amdgpu-amdhsa-assembler-symbol-next_free_sgpr:

.amdgcn.next_free_sgpr
++++++++++++++++++++++

Set to zero before assembly begins. At each instruction, if the current value
of this symbol is less than or equal the maximum SGPR number explicitly
referenced within that instruction then the symbol value is updated to equal
that SGPR number plus one.

May be used to set the `.amdhsa_next_free_spgr` directive in
:ref:`amdhsa-kernel-directives-table`.

May be set at any time, e.g. manually set to zero at the start of each kernel.

.. _amdgpu-amdhsa-assembler-directives-v3:

Code Object V3 Directives (-mattr=+code-object-v3)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Directives which begin with ``.amdgcn`` are valid for all ``amdgcn``
architecture processors, and are not OS-specific. Directives which begin with
``.amdhsa`` are specific to ``amdgcn`` architecture processors when the
``amdhsa`` OS is specified. See :ref:`amdgpu-target-triples` and
:ref:`amdgpu-processors`.

.amdgcn_target <target>
+++++++++++++++++++++++

Optional directive which declares the target supported by the containing
assembler source file. Valid values are described in
:ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-code-object-target-identification`. Used by the assembler
to validate command-line options such as ``-triple``, ``-mcpu``, and those
which specify target features.

.amdhsa_kernel <name>
+++++++++++++++++++++

Creates a correctly aligned AMDHSA kernel descriptor and a symbol,
``<name>.kd``, in the current location of the current section. Only valid when
the OS is ``amdhsa``. ``<name>`` must be a symbol that labels the first
instruction to execute, and does not need to be previously defined.

Marks the beginning of a list of directives used to generate the bytes of a
kernel descriptor, as described in :ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-kernel-descriptor`.
Directives which may appear in this list are described in
:ref:`amdhsa-kernel-directives-table`. Directives may appear in any order, must
be valid for the target being assembled for, and cannot be repeated. Directives
support the range of values specified by the field they reference in
:ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-kernel-descriptor`. If a directive is not specified, it is
assumed to have its default value, unless it is marked as "Required", in which
case it is an error to omit the directive. This list of directives is
terminated by an ``.end_amdhsa_kernel`` directive.

.amdgpu_metadata
++++++++++++++++

Optional directive which declares the contents of the ``NT_AMDGPU_METADATA``
note record (see :ref:`amdgpu-elf-note-records-table-v3`).

The contents must be in the [YAML]_ markup format, with the same structure and
semantics described in :ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-code-object-metadata-v3`.

This directive is terminated by an ``.end_amdgpu_metadata`` directive.

.. _amdgpu-amdhsa-assembler-example-v3:

Code Object V3 Example Source Code (-mattr=+code-object-v3)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Here is an example of a minimal assembly source file, defining one HSA kernel:

.. code::
   :number-lines:

   .amdgcn_target "amdgcn-amd-amdhsa--gfx900+xnack" // optional

   .text
   .globl hello_world
   .p2align 8
   .type hello_world,@function
   hello_world:
     s_load_dwordx2 s[0:1], s[0:1] 0x0
     v_mov_b32 v0, 3.14159
     s_waitcnt lgkmcnt(0)
     v_mov_b32 v1, s0
     v_mov_b32 v2, s1
     flat_store_dword v[1:2], v0
     s_endpgm
   .Lfunc_end0:
     .size   hello_world, .Lfunc_end0-hello_world

   .rodata
   .p2align 6
   .amdhsa_kernel hello_world
     .amdhsa_user_sgpr_kernarg_segment_ptr 1
     .amdhsa_next_free_vgpr .amdgcn.next_free_vgpr
     .amdhsa_next_free_sgpr .amdgcn.next_free_sgpr
   .end_amdhsa_kernel

   .amdgpu_metadata
   ---
   amdhsa.version:
     - 1
     - 0
   amdhsa.kernels:
     - .name: hello_world
       .symbol: hello_world.kd
       .kernarg_segment_size: 48
       .group_segment_fixed_size: 0
       .private_segment_fixed_size: 0
       .kernarg_segment_align: 4
       .wavefront_size: 64
       .sgpr_count: 2
       .vgpr_count: 3
       .max_flat_workgroup_size: 256
   ...
   .end_amdgpu_metadata

If an assembly source file contains multiple kernels and/or functions, the
:ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-assembler-symbol-next_free_vgpr` and
:ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-assembler-symbol-next_free_sgpr` symbols may be reset using
the ``.set <symbol>, <expression>`` directive. For example, in the case of two
kernels, where ``function1`` is only called from ``kernel1`` it is sufficient
to group the function with the kernel that calls it and reset the symbols
between the two connected components:

.. code::
   :number-lines:

   .amdgcn_target "amdgcn-amd-amdhsa--gfx900+xnack" // optional

   // gpr tracking symbols are implicitly set to zero

   .text
   .globl kern0
   .p2align 8
   .type kern0,@function
   kern0:
     // ...
     s_endpgm
   .Lkern0_end:
     .size   kern0, .Lkern0_end-kern0

   .rodata
   .p2align 6
   .amdhsa_kernel kern0
     // ...
     .amdhsa_next_free_vgpr .amdgcn.next_free_vgpr
     .amdhsa_next_free_sgpr .amdgcn.next_free_sgpr
   .end_amdhsa_kernel

   // reset symbols to begin tracking usage in func1 and kern1
   .set .amdgcn.next_free_vgpr, 0
   .set .amdgcn.next_free_sgpr, 0

   .text
   .hidden func1
   .global func1
   .p2align 2
   .type func1,@function
   func1:
     // ...
     s_setpc_b64 s[30:31]
   .Lfunc1_end:
   .size func1, .Lfunc1_end-func1

   .globl kern1
   .p2align 8
   .type kern1,@function
   kern1:
     // ...
     s_getpc_b64 s[4:5]
     s_add_u32 s4, s4, func1@rel32@lo+4
     s_addc_u32 s5, s5, func1@rel32@lo+4
     s_swappc_b64 s[30:31], s[4:5]
     // ...
     s_endpgm
   .Lkern1_end:
     .size   kern1, .Lkern1_end-kern1

   .rodata
   .p2align 6
   .amdhsa_kernel kern1
     // ...
     .amdhsa_next_free_vgpr .amdgcn.next_free_vgpr
     .amdhsa_next_free_sgpr .amdgcn.next_free_sgpr
   .end_amdhsa_kernel

These symbols cannot identify connected components in order to automatically
track the usage for each kernel. However, in some cases careful organization of
the kernels and functions in the source file means there is minimal additional
effort required to accurately calculate GPR usage.
