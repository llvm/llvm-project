Introduction
============

The AMDGPU backend provides ISA code generation for AMD GPUs, starting with the
R600 family up until the current GCN families. It lives in the
``llvm/lib/Target/AMDGPU`` directory.

.. _amdgpu-target-features:

Target Features
---------------

Target features control how code is generated to support certain
processor specific features. Not all target features are supported by
all processors. The runtime must ensure that the features supported by
the device used to execute the code match the features enabled when
generating the code. A mismatch of features may result in incorrect
execution, or a reduction in performance.

The target features supported by each processor, and the default value
used if not specified explicitly, is listed in
:ref:`amdgpu-processor-table`.

Use the ``clang -m[no-]<TargetFeature>`` option to specify the AMDGPU
target features.

For example:

``-mxnack``
  Enable the ``xnack`` feature.
``-mno-xnack``
  Disable the ``xnack`` feature.

                            This is used for demand paging and page
                            migration. If XNACK replay is enabled in
                            the device, then if a page fault occurs
                            the code may execute incorrectly if the
                            ``xnack`` feature is not enabled. Executing
                            code that has the feature enabled on a
                            device that does not have XNACK replay
                            enabled will execute correctly but may
                            be less performant than code with the

                            when enabled CU wavefront execution mode is used

Address Spaces
--------------

The AMDGPU architecture supports a number of memory address spaces. The address
space names use the OpenCL standard names, with some additions.

The AMDGPU address spaces correspond to target architecture specific LLVM
address space numbers used in LLVM IR.

The AMDGPU address spaces are described in
:ref:`amdgpu-address-spaces-table`. Only 64-bit process address spaces are
supported for the ``amdgcn`` target.

**Generic**
  The generic address space uses the hardware flat address support available in
  GFX7-GFX10. This uses two fixed ranges of virtual addresses (the private and
  local apertures), that are outside the range of addressable global memory, to
  map from a flat address to a private or local address.

  FLAT instructions can take a flat address and access global, private
  (scratch), and group (LDS) memory depending on if the address is within one
  of the aperture ranges. Flat access to scratch requires hardware aperture
  setup and setup in the kernel prologue (see
  :ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-kernel-prolog-flat-scratch`). Flat access to LDS requires
  hardware aperture setup and M0 (GFX7-GFX8) register setup (see
  :ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-kernel-prolog-m0`).

  To convert between a private or group address space address (termed a segment
  address) and a flat address the base address of the corresponding aperture
  can be used. For GFX7-GFX8 these are available in the
  :ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-hsa-aql-queue` the address of which can be obtained with
  Queue Ptr SGPR (see :ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-initial-kernel-execution-state`). For
  GFX9-GFX10 the aperture base addresses are directly available as inline
  constant registers ``SRC_SHARED_BASE/LIMIT`` and ``SRC_PRIVATE_BASE/LIMIT``.
  In 64-bit address mode the aperture sizes are 2^32 bytes and the base is
  aligned to 2^32 which makes it easier to convert from flat to segment or
  segment to flat.

  A global address space address has the same value when used as a flat address
  so no conversion is needed.

**Global and Constant**
  The global and constant address spaces both use global virtual addresses,
  which are the same virtual address space used by the CPU. However, some
  virtual addresses may only be accessible to the CPU, some only accessible
  by the GPU, and some by both.

  Using the constant address space indicates that the data will not change
  during the execution of the kernel. This allows scalar read instructions to
  be used. The vector and scalar L1 caches are invalidated of volatile data
  before each kernel dispatch execution to allow constant memory to change
  values between kernel dispatches.

**Region**
  The region address space uses the hardware Global Data Store (GDS). All
  wavefronts executing on the same device will access the same memory for any
  given region address. However, the same region address accessed by wavefronts
  executing on different devices will access different memory. It is higher
  performance than global memory. It is allocated by the runtime. The data
  store (DS) instructions can be used to access it.

**Local**
  The local address space uses the hardware Local Data Store (LDS) which is
  automatically allocated when the hardware creates the wavefronts of a
  work-group, and freed when all the wavefronts of a work-group have
  terminated. All wavefronts belonging to the same work-group will access the
  same memory for any given local address. However, the same local address
  accessed by wavefronts belonging to different work-groups will access
  different memory. It is higher performance than global memory. The data store
  (DS) instructions can be used to access it.

**Private**
  The private address space uses the hardware scratch memory support which
  automatically allocates memory when it creates a wavefront and frees it when
  a wavefronts terminates. The memory accessed by a lane of a wavefront for any
  given private address will be different to the memory accessed by another lane
  of the same or different wavefront for the same private address.

  If a kernel dispatch uses scratch, then the hardware allocates memory from a
  pool of backing memory allocated by the runtime for each wavefront. The lanes
  of the wavefront access this using dword (4 byte) interleaving. The mapping
  used from private address to backing memory address is:

    ``wavefront-scratch-base +
    ((private-address / 4) * wavefront-size * 4) +
    (wavefront-lane-id * 4) + (private-address % 4)``

  If each lane of a wavefront accesses the same private address, the
  interleaving results in adjacent dwords being accessed and hence requires
  fewer cache lines to be fetched.

  There are different ways that the wavefront scratch base address is
  determined by a wavefront (see
  :ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-initial-kernel-execution-state`).

  Scratch memory can be accessed in an interleaved manner using buffer
  instructions with the scratch buffer descriptor and per wavefront scratch
  offset, by the scratch instructions, or by flat instructions. Multi-dword
  access is not supported except by flat and scratch instructions in
  GFX9-GFX10.

**Constant 32-bit**
  *TODO*

**Buffer Fat Pointer**
  The buffer fat pointer is an experimental address space that is currently
  unsupported in the backend. It exposes a non-integral pointer that is in
  the future intended to support the modelling of 128-bit buffer descriptors
  plus a 32-bit offset into the buffer (in total encapsulating a 160-bit
  *pointer*), allowing normal LLVM load/store/atomic operations to be used to
  model the buffer descriptors used heavily in graphics workloads targeting
  the backend.

Memory Scopes
-------------

This section provides LLVM memory synchronization scopes supported by the AMDGPU
backend memory model when the target triple OS is ``amdhsa`` (see
:ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-memory-model` and :ref:`amdgpu-target-triples`).

The memory model supported is based on the HSA memory model [HSA]_ which is
based in turn on HRF-indirect with scope inclusion [HRF]_. The happens-before
relation is transitive over the synchronizes-with relation independent of scope
and synchronizes-with allows the memory scope instances to be inclusive (see
table :ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-llvm-sync-scopes-table`).

This is different to the OpenCL [OpenCL]_ memory model which does not have scope
inclusion and requires the memory scopes to exactly match. However, this
is conservatively correct for OpenCL.

    process address space applications.

``e_ident[EI_DATA]``
  All AMDGPU targets use ``ELFDATA2LSB`` for little-endian byte ordering.

``e_ident[EI_OSABI]``
  One of the following AMDGPU target architecture specific OS ABIs
  (see :ref:`amdgpu-os-table`):

  * ``ELFOSABI_NONE`` for *unknown* OS.

  * ``ELFOSABI_AMDGPU_HSA`` for ``amdhsa`` OS.

  * ``ELFOSABI_AMDGPU_PAL`` for ``amdpal`` OS.

  * ``ELFOSABI_AMDGPU_MESA3D`` for ``mesa3D`` OS.

``e_ident[EI_ABIVERSION]``
  The ABI version of the AMDGPU target architecture specific OS ABI to which the code
  object conforms:

  * ``ELFABIVERSION_AMDGPU_HSA`` is used to specify the version of AMD HSA
    runtime ABI.

  * ``ELFABIVERSION_AMDGPU_PAL`` is used to specify the version of AMD PAL
    runtime ABI.

  * ``ELFABIVERSION_AMDGPU_MESA3D`` is used to specify the version of AMD MESA
    3D runtime ABI.

``e_type``
  Can be one of the following values:


  ``ET_REL``
    The type produced by the AMDGPU backend compiler as it is relocatable code
    object.

  ``ET_DYN``
    The type produced by the linker as it is a shared code object.

  The AMD HSA runtime loader requires a ``ET_DYN`` code object.

``e_machine``
  The value ``EM_AMDGPU`` is used for the machine for all processors supported
  by the ``r600`` and ``amdgcn`` architectures (see
  :ref:`amdgpu-processor-table`). The specific processor is specified in the
  ``EF_AMDGPU_MACH`` bit field of the ``e_flags`` (see
  :ref:`amdgpu-elf-header-e_flags-table`).

``e_entry``
  The entry point is 0 as the entry points for individual kernels must be

These sections have their standard meanings (see [ELF]_) and are only generated
if needed.

``.debug``\ *\**
  The standard DWARF sections. See :ref:`amdgpu-dwarf-debug-information` for
  information on the DWARF produced by the AMDGPU backend.

``.dynamic``, ``.dynstr``, ``.dynsym``, ``.hash``
  The standard sections used by a dynamic loader.

``.note``
  See :ref:`amdgpu-note-records` for the note records supported by the AMDGPU
  backend.

``.rela``\ *name*, ``.rela.dyn``
  For relocatable code objects, *name* is the name of the section that the
  relocation records apply. For example, ``.rela.text`` is the section name for
  relocation records associated with the ``.text`` section.

  For linked shared code objects, ``.rela.dyn`` contains all the relocation
  records from each of the relocatable code object's ``.rela``\ *name* sections.

  See :ref:`amdgpu-relocation-records` for the relocation records supported by
  the AMDGPU backend.

``.text``
  The executable machine code for the kernels and functions they call. Generated
  as position independent code. See :ref:`amdgpu-code-conventions` for
  information on conventions used in the isa generation.

.. _amdgpu-note-records:

Note Records
------------

The AMDGPU backend code object contains ELF note records in the ``.note``
section. The set of generated notes and their semantics depend on the code
object version; see :ref:`amdgpu-note-records-v2` and
:ref:`amdgpu-note-records-v3`.

As required by ``ELFCLASS32`` and ``ELFCLASS64``, minimal zero-byte padding
must be generated after the ``name`` field to ensure the ``desc`` field is 4
byte aligned. In addition, minimal zero-byte padding must be generated to
ensure the ``desc`` field size is a multiple of 4 bytes. The ``sh_addralign``
field of the ``.note`` section must be at least 4 to indicate at least 8 byte
alignment.

     ===================== ================== ================ ==================

Global variable
  Global variables both used and defined by the compilation unit.

  If the symbol is defined in the compilation unit then it is allocated in the
  appropriate section according to if it has initialized data or is readonly.

  If the symbol is external then its section is ``STN_UNDEF`` and the loader
  will resolve relocations using the definition provided by another code object
  or explicitly defined by the runtime.

  If the symbol resides in local/group memory (LDS) then its section is the
  special processor specific section name ``SHN_AMDGPU_LDS``, and the
  ``st_value`` field describes alignment requirements as it does for common
  symbols.

  .. TODO::

     Add description of linked shared object symbols. Seems undefined symbols
     are marked as STT_NOTYPE.

Kernel descriptor
  Every HSA kernel has an associated kernel descriptor. It is the address of the
  kernel descriptor that is used in the AQL dispatch packet used to invoke the
  kernel, not the kernel entry point. The layout of the HSA kernel descriptor is
  defined in :ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-kernel-descriptor`.

Kernel entry point
  Every HSA kernel also has a symbol for its machine code entry point.

.. _amdgpu-relocation-records:

Relocation Records
------------------

AMDGPU backend generates ``Elf64_Rela`` relocation records. Supported
relocatable fields are:

``word32``
  This specifies a 32-bit field occupying 4 bytes with arbitrary byte
  alignment. These values use the same byte order as other word values in the
  AMDGPU architecture.

``word64``
  This specifies a 64-bit field occupying 8 bytes with arbitrary byte
  alignment. These values use the same byte order as other word values in the
  AMDGPU architecture.

Following notations are used for specifying relocation calculations:

**A**
  Represents the addend used to compute the value of the relocatable field.

**G**
  Represents the offset into the global offset table at which the relocation
  entry's symbol will reside during execution.

**GOT**
  Represents the address of the global offset table.

**P**
  Represents the place (section offset for ``et_rel`` or address for ``et_dyn``)
  of the storage unit being relocated (computed using ``r_offset``).

**S**
  Represents the value of the symbol whose index resides in the relocation
  entry. Relocations not using this must specify a symbol index of
  ``STN_UNDEF``.

**B**
  Represents the base address of a loaded executable or shared object which is
  the difference between the ELF address and the actual load address.
  Relocations using this are only valid in executable or shared objects.

The following relocation types are supported:

``R_AMDGPU_ABS32_LO`` and ``R_AMDGPU_ABS32_HI`` are only supported by
the ``mesa3d`` OS, which does not support ``R_AMDGPU_ABS64``.

There is no current OS loader support for 32-bit programs and so
``R_AMDGPU_ABS32`` is not used.

.. _amdgpu-loaded-code-object-path-uniform-resource-identifier:

Loaded Code Object Path Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)
---------------------------------------------------------

The AMD GPU code object loader represents the path of the ELF shared object from
which the code object was loaded as a textual Unifom Resource Identifier (URI).
Note that the code object is the in memory loaded relocated form of the ELF
shared object.  Multiple code objects may be loaded at different memory
addresses in the same process from the same ELF shared object.

The loaded code object path URI syntax is defined by the following BNF syntax:

.. code::

  code_object_uri ::== file_uri | memory_uri
  file_uri        ::== "file://" file_path [ range_specifier ]
  memory_uri      ::== "memory://" process_id range_specifier
  range_specifier ::== [ "#" | "?" ] "offset=" number "&" "size=" number
  file_path       ::== URI_ENCODED_OS_FILE_PATH
  process_id      ::== DECIMAL_NUMBER
  number          ::== HEX_NUMBER | DECIMAL_NUMBER | OCTAL_NUMBER

**number**
  Is a C integral literal where hexadecimal values are prefixed by "0x" or "0X",
  and octal values by "0".

**file_path**
  Is the file's path specified as a URI encoded UTF-8 string. In URI encoding,
  every character that is not in the regular expression ``[a-zA-Z0-9/_.~-]`` is
  encoded as two uppercase hexadecimal digits proceeded by "%".  Directories in
  the path are separated by "/".

**offset**
  Is a 0-based byte offset to the start of the code object.  For a file URI, it
  is from the start of the file specified by the ``file_path``, and if omitted
  defaults to 0. For a memory URI, it is the memory address and is required.

**size**
  Is the number of bytes in the code object.  For a file URI, if omitted it
  defaults to the size of the file.  It is required for a memory URI.

**process_id**
  Is the identity of the process owning the memory.  For Linux it is the C
  unsigned integral decimal literal for the process ID (PID).

For example:

.. code::

  file:///dir1/dir2/file1
  file:///dir3/dir4/file2#offset=0x2000&size=3000
  memory://1234#offset=0x20000&size=3000

.. _amdgpu-dwarf-debug-information:

DWARF Debug Information
=======================

.. warning::

   This section describes **provisional support** for AMDGPU DWARF [DWARF]_ that
   is not currently fully implemented and is subject to change.

AMDGPU generates DWARF [DWARF]_ debugging information ELF sections (see
:ref:`amdgpu-elf-code-object`) which contain information that maps the code
object executable code and data to the source language constructs. It can be
used by tools such as debuggers and profilers. It uses features defined in
:doc:`AMDGPUDwarfExtensionsForHeterogeneousDebugging` that are made available in
DWARF Version 4 and DWARF Version 5 as an LLVM vendor extension.

This section defines the AMDGPU target architecture specific DWARF mappings.

.. _amdgpu-dwarf-register-identifier:

Register Identifier
-------------------

This section defines the AMDGPU target architecture register numbers used in
DWARF operation expressions (see DWARF Version 5 section 2.5 and
:ref:`amdgpu-dwarf-operation-expressions`) and Call Frame Information
instructions (see DWARF Version 5 section 6.4 and
:ref:`amdgpu-dwarf-call-frame-information`).

A single code object can contain code for kernels that have different wavefront
sizes. The vector registers and some scalar registers are based on the wavefront
size. AMDGPU defines distinct DWARF registers for each wavefront size. This
simplifies the consumer of the DWARF so that each register has a fixed size,
rather than being dynamic according to the wavefront size mode. Similarly,
distinct DWARF registers are defined for those registers that vary in size
according to the process address size. This allows a consumer to treat a
specific AMDGPU processor as a single architecture regardless of how it is
configured at run time. The compiler explicitly specifies the DWARF registers
that match the mode in which the code it is generating will be executed.

DWARF registers are encoded as numbers, which are mapped to architecture
registers. The mapping for AMDGPU is defined in
:ref:`amdgpu-dwarf-register-mapping-table`. All AMDGPU targets use the same
mapping.

   ============== ================= ======== ==================================

The vector registers are represented as the full size for the wavefront. They
are organized as consecutive dwords (32-bits), one per lane, with the dword at
the least significant bit position corresponding to lane 0 and so forth. DWARF
location expressions involving the ``DW_OP_LLVM_offset`` and
``DW_OP_LLVM_push_lane`` operations are used to select the part of the vector
register corresponding to the lane that is executing the current thread of
execution in languages that are implemented using a SIMD or SIMT execution
model.

If the wavefront size is 32 lanes then the wavefront 32 mode register
definitions are used. If the wavefront size is 64 lanes then the wavefront 64
mode register definitions are used. Some AMDGPU targets support executing in
both wavefront 32 and wavefront 64 mode. The register definitions corresponding
to the wavefront mode of the generated code will be used.

If code is generated to execute in a 32-bit process address space, then the
32-bit process address space register definitions are used. If code is generated
to execute in a 64-bit process address space, then the 64-bit process address
space register definitions are used. The ``amdgcn`` target only supports the
64-bit process address space.

See :ref:`amdgpu-address-spaces` for information on the AMDGPU address spaces
including address size and NULL value.

The ``DW_ASPACE_none`` address space is the default target architecture address
space used in DWARF operations that do not specify an address space. It
therefore has to map to the global address space so that the ``DW_OP_addr*`` and
related operations can refer to addresses in the program code.

The ``DW_ASPACE_AMDGPU_generic`` address space allows location expressions to
specify the flat address space. If the address corresponds to an address in the
local address space, then it corresponds to the wavefront that is executing the
focused thread of execution. If the address corresponds to an address in the
private address space, then it corresponds to the lane that is executing the
focused thread of execution for languages that are implemented using a SIMD or
SIMT execution model.

.. note::

  CUDA-like languages such as HIP that do not have address spaces in the
  language type system, but do allow variables to be allocated in different
  address spaces, need to explicitly specify the ``DW_ASPACE_AMDGPU_generic``
  address space in the DWARF expression operations as the default address space
  is the global address space.

The ``DW_ASPACE_AMDGPU_local`` address space allows location expressions to
specify the local address space corresponding to the wavefront that is executing
the focused thread of execution.

The ``DW_ASPACE_AMDGPU_private_lane`` address space allows location expressions
to specify the private address space corresponding to the lane that is executing
the focused thread of execution for languages that are implemented using a SIMD
or SIMT execution model.

The ``DW_ASPACE_AMDGPU_private_wave`` address space allows location expressions
to specify the unswizzled private address space corresponding to the wavefront
that is executing the focused thread of execution. The wavefront view of private
memory is the per wavefront unswizzled backing memory layout defined in
:ref:`amdgpu-address-spaces`, such that address 0 corresponds to the first
location for the backing memory of the wavefront (namely the address is not
offset by ``wavefront-scratch-base``). The following formula can be used to
convert from a ``DW_ASPACE_AMDGPU_private_lane`` address to a
``DW_ASPACE_AMDGPU_private_wave`` address:

::

  private-address-wavefront =
    ((private-address-lane / 4) * wavefront-size * 4) +
    (wavefront-lane-id * 4) + (private-address-lane % 4)

If the ``DW_ASPACE_AMDGPU_private_lane`` address is dword aligned, and the start
of the dwords for each lane starting with lane 0 is required, then this
simplifies to:

::

  private-address-wavefront =
    private-address-lane * wavefront-size

A compiler can use the ``DW_ASPACE_AMDGPU_private_wave`` address space to read a
complete spilled vector register back into a complete vector register in the
CFI. The frame pointer can be a private lane address which is dword aligned,
which can be shifted to multiply by the wavefront size, and then used to form a
private wavefront address that gives a location for a contiguous set of dwords,
one per lane, where the vector register dwords are spilled. The compiler knows
the wavefront size since it generates the code. Note that the type of the
address may have to be converted as the size of a
``DW_ASPACE_AMDGPU_private_lane`` address may be smaller than the size of a
``DW_ASPACE_AMDGPU_private_wave`` address.

.. _amdgpu-dwarf-lane-identifier:

Lane identifier
---------------

DWARF lane identifies specify a target architecture lane position for hardware
that executes in a SIMD or SIMT manner, and on which a source language maps its
threads of execution onto those lanes. The DWARF lane identifier is pushed by
the ``DW_OP_LLVM_push_lane`` DWARF expression operation. See DWARF Version 5
section 2.5 which is updated by *DWARF Extensions For Heterogeneous Debugging*
section :ref:`amdgpu-dwarf-operation-expressions`.

For AMDGPU, the lane identifier corresponds to the hardware lane ID of a
wavefront. It is numbered from 0 to the wavefront size minus 1.

Operation Expressions
---------------------

DWARF expressions are used to compute program values and the locations of
program objects. See DWARF Version 5 section 2.5 and
:ref:`amdgpu-dwarf-operation-expressions`.

DWARF location descriptions describe how to access storage which includes memory
and registers. When accessing storage on AMDGPU, bytes are ordered with least
significant bytes first, and bits are ordered within bytes with least
significant bits first.

For AMDGPU CFI expressions, ``DW_OP_LLVM_select_bit_piece`` is used to describe
unwinding vector registers that are spilled under the execution mask to memory:
the zero-single location description is the vector register, and the one-single
location description is the spilled memory location description. The
``DW_OP_LLVM_form_aspace_address`` is used to specify the address space of the
memory location description.

In AMDGPU expressions, ``DW_OP_LLVM_select_bit_piece`` is used by the
``DW_AT_LLVM_lane_pc`` attribute expression where divergent control flow is
controlled by the execution mask. An undefined location description together
with ``DW_OP_LLVM_extend`` is used to indicate the lane was not active on entry
to the subprogram. See :ref:`amdgpu-dwarf-dw-at-llvm-lane-pc` for an example.

Debugger Information Entry Attributes
-------------------------------------

This section describes how certain debugger information entry attributes are
used by AMDGPU. See the sections in DWARF Version 5 section 2 which are updated
by *DWARF Extensions For Heterogeneous Debugging* section
:ref:`amdgpu-dwarf-debugging-information-entry-attributes`.

.. _amdgpu-dwarf-dw-at-llvm-lane-pc:

``DW_AT_LLVM_lane_pc``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For AMDGPU, the ``DW_AT_LLVM_lane_pc`` attribute is used to specify the program
location of the separate lanes of a SIMT thread.

If the lane is an active lane then this will be the same as the current program
location.

If the lane is inactive, but was active on entry to the subprogram, then this is
the program location in the subprogram at which execution of the lane is
conceptual positioned.

If the lane was not active on entry to the subprogram, then this will be the
undefined location. A client debugger can check if the lane is part of a valid
work-group by checking that the lane is in the range of the associated
work-group within the grid, accounting for partial work-groups. If it is not,
then the debugger can omit any information for the lane. Otherwise, the debugger
may repeatedly unwind the stack and inspect the ``DW_AT_LLVM_lane_pc`` of the
calling subprogram until it finds a non-undefined location. Conceptually the
lane only has the call frames that it has a non-undefined
``DW_AT_LLVM_lane_pc``.

The following example illustrates how the AMDGPU backend can generate a DWARF
location list expression for the nested ``IF/THEN/ELSE`` structures of the
following subprogram pseudo code for a target with 64 lanes per wavefront.

.. code::
  :number-lines:

  SUBPROGRAM X
  BEGIN
    a;
    IF (c1) THEN
      b;
      IF (c2) THEN
        c;
      ELSE
        d;
      ENDIF
      e;
    ELSE
      f;
    ENDIF
    g;
  END

The AMDGPU backend may generate the following pseudo LLVM MIR to manipulate the
execution mask (``EXEC``) to linearize the control flow. The condition is
evaluated to make a mask of the lanes for which the condition evaluates to true.
First the ``THEN`` region is executed by setting the ``EXEC`` mask to the
logical ``AND`` of the current ``EXEC`` mask with the condition mask. Then the
``ELSE`` region is executed by negating the ``EXEC`` mask and logical ``AND`` of
the saved ``EXEC`` mask at the start of the region. After the ``IF/THEN/ELSE``
region the ``EXEC`` mask is restored to the value it had at the beginning of the
region. This is shown below. Other approaches are possible, but the basic
concept is the same.

.. code::
  :number-lines:

  $lex_start:
    a;
    %1 = EXEC
    %2 = c1
  $lex_1_start:
    EXEC = %1 & %2
  $if_1_then:
      b;
      %3 = EXEC
      %4 = c2
  $lex_1_1_start:
      EXEC = %3 & %4
  $lex_1_1_then:
        c;
      EXEC = ~EXEC & %3
  $lex_1_1_else:
        d;
      EXEC = %3
  $lex_1_1_end:
      e;
    EXEC = ~EXEC & %1
  $lex_1_else:
      f;
    EXEC = %1
  $lex_1_end:
    g;
  $lex_end:

To create the DWARF location list expression that defines the location
description of a vector of lane program locations, the LLVM MIR ``DBG_VALUE``
pseudo instruction can be used to annotate the linearized control flow. This can
be done by defining an artificial variable for the lane PC. The DWARF location
list expression created for it is used as the value of the
``DW_AT_LLVM_lane_pc`` attribute on the subprogram's debugger information entry.

A DWARF procedure is defined for each well nested structured control flow region
which provides the conceptual lane program location for a lane if it is not
active (namely it is divergent). The DWARF operation expression for each region
conceptually inherits the value of the immediately enclosing region and modifies
it according to the semantics of the region.

For an ``IF/THEN/ELSE`` region the divergent program location is at the start of
the region for the ``THEN`` region since it is executed first. For the ``ELSE``
region the divergent program location is at the end of the ``IF/THEN/ELSE``
region since the ``THEN`` region has completed.

The lane PC artificial variable is assigned at each region transition. It uses
the immediately enclosing region's DWARF procedure to compute the program
location for each lane assuming they are divergent, and then modifies the result
by inserting the current program location for each lane that the ``EXEC`` mask
indicates is active.

By having separate DWARF procedures for each region, they can be reused to
define the value for any nested region. This reduces the total size of the DWARF
operation expressions.

The following provides an example using pseudo LLVM MIR.

The DWARF procedure ``%__active_lane_pc`` is used to update the lane pc elements
that are active, with the current program location.

Artificial variables %__lex_1_save_exec and %__lex_1_1_save_exec are created for
the execution masks saved on entry to a region. Using the ``DBG_VALUE`` pseudo
instruction, location list entries will be created that describe where the
artificial variables are allocated at any given program location. The compiler
may allocate them to registers or spill them to memory.

The DWARF procedures for each region use the values of the saved execution mask
artificial variables to only update the lanes that are active on entry to the
region. All other lanes retain the value of the enclosing region where they were
last active. If they were not active on entry to the subprogram, then will have
the undefined location description.

Other structured control flow regions can be handled similarly. For example,
loops would set the divergent program location for the region at the end of the
loop. Any lanes active will be in the loop, and any lanes not active must have
exited the loop.

An ``IF/THEN/ELSEIF/ELSEIF/...`` region can be treated as a nest of
``IF/THEN/ELSE`` regions.

The DWARF procedures can use the active lane artificial variable described in
:ref:`amdgpu-dwarf-amdgpu-dw-at-llvm-active-lane` rather than the actual
``EXEC`` mask in order to support whole or quad wavefront mode.

.. _amdgpu-dwarf-amdgpu-dw-at-llvm-active-lane:

``DW_AT_LLVM_active_lane``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``DW_AT_LLVM_active_lane`` attribute on a subprogram debugger information
entry is used to specify the lanes that are conceptually active for a SIMT
thread.

The execution mask may be modified to implement whole or quad wavefront mode
operations. For example, all lanes may need to temporarily be made active to
execute a whole wavefront operation. Such regions would save the ``EXEC`` mask,
update it to enable the necessary lanes, perform the operations, and then
restore the ``EXEC`` mask from the saved value. While executing the whole
wavefront region, the conceptual execution mask is the saved value, not the
``EXEC`` value.

This is handled by defining an artificial variable for the active lane mask. The
active lane mask artificial variable would be the actual ``EXEC`` mask for
normal regions, and the saved execution mask for regions where the mask is
temporarily updated. The location list expression created for this artificial
variable is used to define the value of the ``DW_AT_LLVM_active_lane``
attribute.

``DW_AT_LLVM_augmentation``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For AMDGPU, the ``DW_AT_LLVM_augmentation`` attribute of a compilation unit
debugger information entry has the following value for the augmentation string:

::

  [amdgpu:v0.0]

The "vX.Y" specifies the major X and minor Y version number of the AMDGPU
extensions used in the DWARF of the compilation unit. The version number
conforms to [SEMVER]_.

Call Frame Information
----------------------

DWARF Call Frame Information (CFI) describes how a consumer can virtually
*unwind* call frames in a running process or core dump. See DWARF Version 5
section 6.4 and :ref:`amdgpu-dwarf-call-frame-information`.

For AMDGPU, the Common Information Entry (CIE) fields have the following values:

1.  ``augmentation`` string contains the following null-terminated UTF-8 string:

    ::

      [amd:v0.0]

    The ``vX.Y`` specifies the major X and minor Y version number of the AMDGPU
    extensions used in this CIE or to the FDEs that use it. The version number
    conforms to [SEMVER]_.

2.  ``address_size`` for the ``Global`` address space is defined in
    :ref:`amdgpu-dwarf-address-space-identifier`.

3.  ``segment_selector_size`` is 0 as AMDGPU does not use a segment selector.

4.  ``code_alignment_factor`` is 4 bytes.

    .. TODO::

       Add to :ref:`amdgpu-processor-table` table.

5.  ``data_alignment_factor`` is 4 bytes.

    .. TODO::

       Add to :ref:`amdgpu-processor-table` table.

6.  ``return_address_register`` is ``PC_32`` for 32-bit processes and ``PC_64``
    for 64-bit processes defined in :ref:`amdgpu-dwarf-register-identifier`.

7.  ``initial_instructions`` Since a subprogram X with fewer registers can be
    called from subprogram Y that has more allocated, X will not change any of
    the extra registers as it cannot access them. Therefore, the default rule
    for all columns is ``same value``.

For AMDGPU the register number follows the numbering defined in
:ref:`amdgpu-dwarf-register-identifier`.

For AMDGPU the instructions are variable size. A consumer can subtract 1 from
the return address to get the address of a byte within the call site
instructions. See DWARF Version 5 section 6.4.4.

Accelerated Access
------------------

See DWARF Version 5 section 6.1.

Lookup By Name Section Header
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

See DWARF Version 5 section 6.1.1.4.1 and :ref:`amdgpu-dwarf-lookup-by-name`.

For AMDGPU the lookup by name section header table:

``augmentation_string_size`` (uword)

  Set to the length of the ``augmentation_string`` value which is always a
  multiple of 4.

``augmentation_string`` (sequence of UTF-8 characters)

  Contains the following UTF-8 string null padded to a multiple of 4 bytes:

  ::

    [amdgpu:v0.0]

  The "vX.Y" specifies the major X and minor Y version number of the AMDGPU
  extensions used in the DWARF of this index. The version number conforms to
  [SEMVER]_.

  .. note::

    This is different to the DWARF Version 5 definition that requires the first
    4 characters to be the vendor ID. But this is consistent with the other
    augmentation strings and does allow multiple vendor contributions. However,
    backwards compatibility may be more desirable.

Lookup By Address Section Header
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

See DWARF Version 5 section 6.1.2.

For AMDGPU the lookup by address section header table:

``address_size`` (ubyte)

  Match the address size for the ``Global`` address space defined in
  :ref:`amdgpu-dwarf-address-space-identifier`.

``segment_selector_size`` (ubyte)

  AMDGPU does not use a segment selector so this is 0. The entries in the
  ``.debug_aranges`` do not have a segment selector.

Line Number Information
-----------------------

See DWARF Version 5 section 6.2 and :ref:`amdgpu-dwarf-line-number-information`.

AMDGPU does not use the ``isa`` state machine registers and always sets it to 0.
The instruction set must be obtained from the ELF file header ``e_flags`` field
in the ``EF_AMDGPU_MACH`` bit position (see :ref:`ELF Header
<amdgpu-elf-header>`). See DWARF Version 5 section 6.2.2.

.. TODO::

  Should the ``isa`` state machine register be used to indicate if the code is
  in wavefront32 or wavefront64 mode? Or used to specify the architecture ISA?

For AMDGPU the line number program header fields have the following values (see
DWARF Version 5 section 6.2.4):

``address_size`` (ubyte)
  Matches the address size for the ``Global`` address space defined in
  :ref:`amdgpu-dwarf-address-space-identifier`.

``segment_selector_size`` (ubyte)
  AMDGPU does not use a segment selector so this is 0.

``minimum_instruction_length`` (ubyte)
  For GFX9-GFX10 this is 4.

``maximum_operations_per_instruction`` (ubyte)
  For GFX9-GFX10 this is 1.

Source text for online-compiled programs (for example, those compiled by the
OpenCL language runtime) may be embedded into the DWARF Version 5 line table.
See DWARF Version 5 section 6.2.4.1 which is updated by *DWARF Extensions For
Heterogeneous Debugging* section :ref:`DW_LNCT_LLVM_source
<amdgpu-dwarf-line-number-information-dw-lnct-llvm-source>`.

The Clang option used to control source embedding in AMDGPU is defined in
:ref:`amdgpu-clang-debug-options-table`.

  .. table:: AMDGPU Clang Debug Options
     :name: amdgpu-clang-debug-options-table

     ==================== ==================================================
     Debug Flag           Description
     ==================== ==================================================
     -g[no-]embed-source  Enable/disable embedding source text in DWARF
                          debug sections. Useful for environments where
                          source cannot be written to disk, such as
                          when performing online compilation.
     ==================== ==================================================

For example:

``-gembed-source``
  Enable the embedded source.

``-gno-embed-source``
  Disable the embedded source.

32-Bit and 64-Bit DWARF Formats
-------------------------------

See DWARF Version 5 section 7.4 and
:ref:`amdgpu-dwarf-32-bit-and-64-bit-dwarf-formats`.

For AMDGPU:

* For the ``amdgcn`` target architecture only the 64-bit process address space
  is supported.

* The producer can generate either 32-bit or 64-bit DWARF format. LLVM generates
  the 32-bit DWARF format.

Unit Headers
------------

For AMDGPU the following values apply for each of the unit headers described in
DWARF Version 5 sections 7.5.1.1, 7.5.1.2, and 7.5.1.3:

``address_size`` (ubyte)
  Matches the address size for the ``Global`` address space defined in
  :ref:`amdgpu-dwarf-address-space-identifier`.

.. _amdgpu-code-conventions:

Code Conventions
================

This section provides code conventions used for each supported target triple OS
(see :ref:`amdgpu-target-triples`).

AMDHSA
------

This section provides code conventions used when the target triple OS is
``amdhsa`` (see :ref:`amdgpu-target-triples`).

.. _amdgpu-amdhsa-code-object-target-identification:

Code Object Target Identification
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The AMDHSA OS uses the following syntax to specify the code object
target as a single string:

  ``<Architecture>-<Vendor>-<OS>-<Environment>-<Processor><Target Features>``

Where:

  - ``<Architecture>``, ``<Vendor>``, ``<OS>`` and ``<Environment>``
    are the same as the *Target Triple* (see
    :ref:`amdgpu-target-triples`).

  - ``<Processor>`` is the same as the *Processor* (see
    :ref:`amdgpu-processors`).

  - ``<Target Features>`` is a list of the enabled *Target Features*
    (see :ref:`amdgpu-target-features`), each prefixed by a plus, that
    apply to *Processor*. The list must be in the same order as listed
    in the table :ref:`amdgpu-target-feature-table`. Note that *Target
    Features* must be included in the list if they are enabled even if
    that is the default for *Processor*.

For example:

  ``"amdgcn-amd-amdhsa--gfx902+xnack"``

.. _amdgpu-amdhsa-code-object-metadata:

Code Object Metadata
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The code object metadata specifies extensible metadata associated with the code
objects executed on HSA [HSA]_ compatible runtimes such as AMD's ROCm
[AMD-ROCm]_. The encoding and semantics of this metadata depends on the code
object version; see :ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-code-object-metadata-v2` and
:ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-code-object-metadata-v3`.

Code object metadata is specified in a note record (see
:ref:`amdgpu-note-records`) and is required when the target triple OS is
``amdhsa`` (see :ref:`amdgpu-target-triples`). It must contain the minimum
information necessary to support the ROCM kernel queries. For example, the
segment sizes needed in a dispatch packet. In addition, a high-level language
runtime may require other information to be included. For example, the AMD
OpenCL runtime records kernel argument information.

.. _amdgpu-amdhsa-code-object-metadata-v2:

Code Object V2 Metadata (--amdhsa-code-object-version=2)
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

.. warning:: Code Object V2 is not the default code object version emitted by
  this version of LLVM. For a description of the metadata generated with the
  default configuration (Code Object V3) see
  :ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-code-object-metadata-v3`.

Code object V2 metadata is specified by the ``NT_AMD_AMDGPU_METADATA`` note
record (see :ref:`amdgpu-note-records-v2`).

The metadata is specified as a YAML formatted string (see [YAML]_ and
:doc:`YamlIO`).

.. TODO::

  Is the string null terminated? It probably should not if YAML allows it to
  contain null characters, otherwise it should be.

The metadata is represented as a single YAML document comprised of the mapping
defined in table :ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-code-object-metadata-map-table-v2` and
referenced tables.

For boolean values, the string values of ``false`` and ``true`` are used for
false and true respectively.

Additional information can be added to the mappings. To avoid conflicts, any
non-AMD key names should be prefixed by "*vendor-name*.".

Code Object V3 Metadata (--amdhsa-code-object-version=3)
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Code object V3 metadata is specified by the ``NT_AMDGPU_METADATA`` note record
(see :ref:`amdgpu-note-records-v3`).

The metadata is represented as Message Pack formatted binary data (see
[MsgPack]_). The top level is a Message Pack map that includes the
keys defined in table
:ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-code-object-metadata-map-table-v3` and referenced
tables.

Additional information can be added to the maps. To avoid conflicts,
any key names should be prefixed by "*vendor-name*." where
``vendor-name`` can be the name of the vendor and specific vendor
tool that generates the information. The prefix is abbreviated to
simply "." when it appears within a map that has been added by the
same *vendor-name*.

Kernel Dispatch
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The HSA architected queuing language (AQL) defines a user space memory
interface that can be used to control the dispatch of kernels, in an agent
independent way. An agent can have zero or more AQL queues created for it using
the ROCm runtime, in which AQL packets (all of which are 64 bytes) can be
placed. See the *HSA Platform System Architecture Specification* [HSA]_ for the
AQL queue mechanics and packet layouts.

The packet processor of a kernel agent is responsible for detecting and
dispatching HSA kernels from the AQL queues associated with it. For AMD GPUs the
packet processor is implemented by the hardware command processor (CP),
asynchronous dispatch controller (ADC) and shader processor input controller
(SPI).

The ROCm runtime can be used to allocate an AQL queue object. It uses the kernel
mode driver to initialize and register the AQL queue with CP.

To dispatch a kernel the following actions are performed. This can occur in the
CPU host program, or from an HSA kernel executing on a GPU.

1. A pointer to an AQL queue for the kernel agent on which the kernel is to be
   executed is obtained.
2. A pointer to the kernel descriptor (see
   :ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-kernel-descriptor`) of the kernel to execute is obtained.
   It must be for a kernel that is contained in a code object that that was
   loaded by the ROCm runtime on the kernel agent with which the AQL queue is
   associated.
3. Space is allocated for the kernel arguments using the ROCm runtime allocator
   for a memory region with the kernarg property for the kernel agent that will
   execute the kernel. It must be at least 16-byte aligned.
4. Kernel argument values are assigned to the kernel argument memory
   allocation. The layout is defined in the *HSA Programmer's Language
   Reference* [HSA]_. For AMDGPU the kernel execution directly accesses the
   kernel argument memory in the same way constant memory is accessed. (Note
   that the HSA specification allows an implementation to copy the kernel
   argument contents to another location that is accessed by the kernel.)
5. An AQL kernel dispatch packet is created on the AQL queue. The ROCm runtime
   api uses 64-bit atomic operations to reserve space in the AQL queue for the
   packet. The packet must be set up, and the final write must use an atomic
   store release to set the packet kind to ensure the packet contents are
   visible to the kernel agent. AQL defines a doorbell signal mechanism to
   notify the kernel agent that the AQL queue has been updated. These rules, and
   the layout of the AQL queue and kernel dispatch packet is defined in the *HSA
   System Architecture Specification* [HSA]_.
6. A kernel dispatch packet includes information about the actual dispatch,
   such as grid and work-group size, together with information from the code
   object about the kernel, such as segment sizes. The ROCm runtime queries on
   the kernel symbol can be used to obtain the code object values which are
   recorded in the :ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-code-object-metadata`.
7. CP executes micro-code and is responsible for detecting and setting up the
   GPU to execute the wavefronts of a kernel dispatch.
8. CP ensures that when the a wavefront starts executing the kernel machine
   code, the scalar general purpose registers (SGPR) and vector general purpose
   registers (VGPR) are set up as required by the machine code. The required
   setup is defined in the :ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-kernel-descriptor`. The initial
   register state is defined in
   :ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-initial-kernel-execution-state`.
9. The prolog of the kernel machine code (see
   :ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-kernel-prolog`) sets up the machine state as necessary
   before continuing executing the machine code that corresponds to the kernel.
10. When the kernel dispatch has completed execution, CP signals the completion
    signal specified in the kernel dispatch packet if not 0.

Image and Samplers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Image and sample handles created by the ROCm runtime are 64-bit addresses of a
hardware 32-byte V# and 48 byte S# object respectively. In order to support the
HSA ``query_sampler`` operations two extra dwords are used to store the HSA BRIG
enumeration values for the queries that are not trivially deducible from the S#
representation.

HSA Signals
~~~~~~~~~~~

HSA signal handles created by the ROCm runtime are 64-bit addresses of a
structure allocated in memory accessible from both the CPU and GPU. The
structure is defined by the ROCm runtime and subject to change between releases
(see [AMD-ROCm-github]_).

.. _amdgpu-amdhsa-hsa-aql-queue:

HSA AQL Queue
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The HSA AQL queue structure is defined by the ROCm runtime and subject to change
between releases (see [AMD-ROCm-github]_). For some processors it contains
fields needed to implement certain language features such as the flat address
aperture bases. It also contains fields used by CP such as managing the
allocation of scratch memory.

.. _amdgpu-amdhsa-kernel-descriptor:

Kernel Descriptor
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A kernel descriptor consists of the information needed by CP to initiate the
execution of a kernel, including the entry point address of the machine code
that implements the kernel.

Initial Kernel Execution State
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This section defines the register state that will be set up by the packet
processor prior to the start of execution of every wavefront. This is limited by
the constraints of the hardware controllers of CP/ADC/SPI.

The order of the SGPR registers is defined, but the compiler can specify which
ones are actually setup in the kernel descriptor using the ``enable_sgpr_*`` bit
fields (see :ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-kernel-descriptor`). The register numbers used
for enabled registers are dense starting at SGPR0: the first enabled register is
SGPR0, the next enabled register is SGPR1 etc.; disabled registers do not have
an SGPR number.

The initial SGPRs comprise up to 16 User SRGPs that are set by CP and apply to
all wavefronts of the grid. It is possible to specify more than 16 User SGPRs
using the ``enable_sgpr_*`` bit fields, in which case only the first 16 are
actually initialized. These are then immediately followed by the System SGPRs
that are set up by ADC/SPI and can have different values for each wavefront of
the grid dispatch.

SGPR register initial state is defined in
:ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-sgpr-register-set-up-order-table`.

     First      Private Segment Buffer     4      V# that can be used, together
                (enable_sgpr_private              with Scratch Wavefront Offset
                _segment_buffer)                  as an offset, to access the
                                                  private address space using a
                                                  segment address.

                                                  CP uses the value provided by
                                                  the runtime.
     then       Dispatch Ptr               2      64-bit address of AQL dispatch
                (enable_sgpr_dispatch_ptr)        packet for kernel dispatch
                                                  actually executing.
     then       Queue Ptr                  2      64-bit address of amd_queue_t
                (enable_sgpr_queue_ptr)           object for AQL queue on which
                                                  the dispatch packet was
                                                  queued.
     then       Kernarg Segment Ptr        2      64-bit address of Kernarg
                (enable_sgpr_kernarg              segment. This is directly
                _segment_ptr)                     copied from the
                                                  kernarg_address in the kernel
                                                  dispatch packet.

                                                  Having CP load it once avoids
                                                  loading it at the beginning of
                                                  every wavefront.
     then       Dispatch Id                2      64-bit Dispatch ID of the
                (enable_sgpr_dispatch_id)         dispatch packet being
                                                  executed.
     then       Flat Scratch Init          2      This is 2 SGPRs:
                (enable_sgpr_flat_scratch

                                                  GFX7-GFX8
                                                    The first SGPR is a 32-bit
                                                    byte offset from
                                                    ``SH_HIDDEN_PRIVATE_BASE_VIMID``
                                                    to per SPI base of memory

                                                    executing the kernel
                                                    dispatch. CP obtains this
                                                    from the runtime. (The
                                                    Scratch Segment Buffer base

                                                    plus this offset.) The value
                                                    of Scratch Wavefront Offset must
                                                    be added to this offset by
                                                    the kernel machine code,
                                                    right shifted by 8, and
                                                    moved to the FLAT_SCRATCH_HI
                                                    SGPR register.
                                                    FLAT_SCRATCH_HI corresponds
                                                    to SGPRn-4 on GFX7, and
                                                    SGPRn-6 on GFX8 (where SGPRn
                                                    is the highest numbered SGPR
                                                    allocated to the wavefront).
                                                    FLAT_SCRATCH_HI is
                                                    multiplied by 256 (as it is
                                                    in units of 256 bytes) and
                                                    added to
                                                    ``SH_HIDDEN_PRIVATE_BASE_VIMID``
                                                    to calculate the per wavefront
                                                    FLAT SCRATCH BASE in flat
                                                    memory instructions that
                                                    access the scratch
                                                    aperture.

                                                    The second SGPR is 32-bit
                                                    byte size of a single
                                                    work-item's scratch memory
                                                    usage. CP obtains this from
                                                    the runtime, and it is
                                                    always a multiple of DWORD.
                                                    CP checks that the value in
                                                    the kernel dispatch packet
                                                    Private Segment Byte Size is
                                                    not larger and requests the
                                                    runtime to increase the
                                                    queue's scratch size if
                                                    necessary. The kernel code
                                                    must move it to
                                                    FLAT_SCRATCH_LO which is
                                                    SGPRn-3 on GFX7 and SGPRn-5
                                                    on GFX8. FLAT_SCRATCH_LO is
                                                    used as the FLAT SCRATCH
                                                    SIZE in flat memory
                                                    instructions. Having CP load
                                                    it once avoids loading it at
                                                    the beginning of every
                                                    wavefront.
                                                  GFX9-GFX10
                                                    This is the
                                                    64-bit base address of the
                                                    per SPI scratch backing
                                                    memory managed by SPI for
                                                    the queue executing the
                                                    kernel dispatch. CP obtains
                                                    this from the runtime (and
                                                    divides it if there are
                                                    multiple Shader Arrays each
                                                    with its own SPI). The value
                                                    of Scratch Wavefront Offset must
                                                    be added by the kernel
                                                    machine code and the result
                                                    moved to the FLAT_SCRATCH
                                                    SGPR which is SGPRn-6 and
                                                    SGPRn-5. It is used as the
                                                    FLAT SCRATCH BASE in flat
                                                    memory instructions.
     then       Private Segment Size       1      The 32-bit byte size of a
                                                  (enable_sgpr_private single
                                                  work-item's
                                                  scratch_segment_size) memory
                                                  allocation. This is the
                                                  value from the kernel
                                                  dispatch packet Private

                                                  by CP to a multiple of
                                                  DWORD.

                                                  Having CP load it once avoids
                                                  loading it at the beginning of
                                                  every wavefront.

                                                  This is not used for
                                                  GFX7-GFX8 since it is the same
                                                  value as the second SGPR of
                                                  Flat Scratch Init. However, it
                                                  may be needed for GFX9-GFX10 which
                                                  changes the meaning of the
                                                  Flat Scratch Init value.

The order of the VGPR registers is defined, but the compiler can specify which
ones are actually setup in the kernel descriptor using the ``enable_vgpr*`` bit
fields (see :ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-kernel-descriptor`). The register numbers used
for enabled registers are dense starting at VGPR0: the first enabled register is
VGPR0, the next enabled register is VGPR1 etc.; disabled registers do not have a
VGPR number.

VGPR register initial state is defined in

     ========== ========================== ====== ==============================

The setting of registers is done by GPU CP/ADC/SPI hardware as follows:

1. SGPRs before the Work-Group Ids are set by CP using the 16 User Data
   registers.
2. Work-group Id registers X, Y, Z are set by ADC which supports any
   combination including none.
3. Scratch Wavefront Offset is set by SPI in a per wavefront basis which is why
   its value cannot be included with the flat scratch init value which is per
   queue.
4. The VGPRs are set by SPI which only supports specifying either (X), (X, Y)
   or (X, Y, Z).

Flat Scratch register pair are adjacent SGPRs so they can be moved as a 64-bit
value to the hardware required SGPRn-3 and SGPRn-4 respectively.

The global segment can be accessed either using buffer instructions (GFX6 which
has V# 64-bit address support), flat instructions (GFX7-GFX10), or global
instructions (GFX9-GFX10).

If buffer operations are used, then the compiler can generate a V# with the
following properties:

* base address of 0
* no swizzle
* ATC: 1 if IOMMU present (such as APU)
* ptr64: 1
* MTYPE set to support memory coherence that matches the runtime (such as CC for
  APU and NC for dGPU).

.. _amdgpu-amdhsa-kernel-prolog:

Kernel Prolog
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The compiler performs initialization in the kernel prologue depending on the
target and information about things like stack usage in the kernel and called
functions. Some of this initialization requires the compiler to request certain
User and System SGPRs be present in the
:ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-initial-kernel-execution-state` via the
:ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-kernel-descriptor`.

.. _amdgpu-amdhsa-kernel-prolog-cfi:

CFI
+++

1.  The CFI return address is undefined.

2.  The CFI CFA is defined using an expression which evaluates to a location
    description that comprises one memory location description for the
    ``DW_ASPACE_AMDGPU_private_lane`` address space address ``0``.

.. _amdgpu-amdhsa-kernel-prolog-m0:

M0
++

GFX6-GFX8
  The M0 register must be initialized with a value at least the total LDS size
  if the kernel may access LDS via DS or flat operations. Total LDS size is
  available in dispatch packet. For M0, it is also possible to use maximum
  possible value of LDS for given target (0x7FFF for GFX6 and 0xFFFF for
  GFX7-GFX8).
GFX9-GFX10
  The M0 register is not used for range checking LDS accesses and so does not
  need to be initialized in the prolog.

.. _amdgpu-amdhsa-kernel-prolog-stack-pointer:

Stack Pointer
+++++++++++++

If the kernel has function calls it must set up the ABI stack pointer described
in :ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-function-call-convention-non-kernel-functions` by setting
SGPR32 to the unswizzled scratch offset of the address past the last local
allocation.

.. _amdgpu-amdhsa-kernel-prolog-frame-pointer:

Frame Pointer
+++++++++++++

If the kernel needs a frame pointer for the reasons defined in
``SIFrameLowering`` then SGPR33 is used and is always set to ``0`` in the
kernel prolog. If a frame pointer is not required then all uses of the frame
pointer are replaced with immediate ``0`` offsets.

.. _amdgpu-amdhsa-kernel-prolog-flat-scratch:

Flat Scratch
++++++++++++

If the kernel or any function it calls may use flat operations to access
scratch memory, the prolog code must set up the FLAT_SCRATCH register pair
(FLAT_SCRATCH_LO/FLAT_SCRATCH_HI which are in SGPRn-4/SGPRn-3). Initialization
uses Flat Scratch Init and Scratch Wavefront Offset SGPR registers (see
:ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-initial-kernel-execution-state`):

GFX6
  Flat scratch is not supported.

GFX7-GFX8

  1. The low word of Flat Scratch Init is 32-bit byte offset from
     ``SH_HIDDEN_PRIVATE_BASE_VIMID`` to the base of scratch backing memory
     being managed by SPI for the queue executing the kernel dispatch. This is
     the same value used in the Scratch Segment Buffer V# base address. The
     prolog must add the value of Scratch Wavefront Offset to get the
     wavefront's byte scratch backing memory offset from
     ``SH_HIDDEN_PRIVATE_BASE_VIMID``. Since FLAT_SCRATCH_LO is in units of 256
     bytes, the offset must be right shifted by 8 before moving into
     FLAT_SCRATCH_LO.
  2. The second word of Flat Scratch Init is 32-bit byte size of a single
     work-items scratch memory usage. This is directly loaded from the kernel
     dispatch packet Private Segment Byte Size and rounded up to a multiple of
     DWORD. Having CP load it once avoids loading it at the beginning of every
     wavefront. The prolog must move it to FLAT_SCRATCH_LO for use as FLAT
     SCRATCH SIZE.

GFX9-GFX10
  The Flat Scratch Init is the 64-bit address of the base of scratch backing
  memory being managed by SPI for the queue executing the kernel dispatch. The
  prolog must add the value of Scratch Wavefront Offset and moved to the
  FLAT_SCRATCH pair for use as the flat scratch base in flat memory
  instructions.

.. _amdgpu-amdhsa-kernel-prolog-private-segment-buffer:

Private Segment Buffer
++++++++++++++++++++++

A set of four SGPRs beginning at a four-aligned SGPR index are always selected
to serve as the scratch V# for the kernel as follows:

  - If it is known during instruction selection that there is stack usage,
    SGPR0-3 is reserved for use as the scratch V#.  Stack usage is assumed if
    optimizations are disabled (``-O0``), if stack objects already exist (for
    locals, etc.), or if there are any function calls.

  - Otherwise, four high numbered SGPRs beginning at a four-aligned SGPR index
    are reserved for the tentative scratch V#. These will be used if it is
    determined that spilling is needed.

    - If no use is made of the tentative scratch V#, then it is unreserved,
      and the register count is determined ignoring it.
    - If use is made of the tentative scratch V#, then its register numbers
      are shifted to the first four-aligned SGPR index after the highest one
      allocated by the register allocator, and all uses are updated. The
      register count includes them in the shifted location.
    - In either case, if the processor has the SGPR allocation bug, the
      tentative allocation is not shifted or unreserved in order to ensure
      the register count is higher to workaround the bug.

    .. note::

      This approach of using a tentative scratch V# and shifting the register
      numbers if used avoids having to perform register allocation a second
      time if the tentative V# is eliminated. This is more efficient and
      avoids the problem that the second register allocation may perform
      spilling which will fail as there is no longer a scratch V#.

When the kernel prolog code is being emitted it is known whether the scratch V#
described above is actually used. If it is, the prolog code must set it up by
copying the Private Segment Buffer to the scratch V# registers and then adding
the Private Segment Wavefront Offset to the queue base address in the V#. The
result is a V# with a base address pointing to the beginning of the wavefront
scratch backing memory.

The Private Segment Buffer is always requested, but the Private Segment
Wavefront Offset is only requested if it is used (see
:ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-initial-kernel-execution-state`).

.. _amdgpu-amdhsa-memory-model:

Memory Model
~~~~~~~~~~~~

This section describes the mapping of LLVM memory model onto AMDGPU machine code
(see :ref:`memmodel`).

The AMDGPU backend supports the memory synchronization scopes specified in
:ref:`amdgpu-memory-scopes`.

The code sequences used to implement the memory model are defined in table
:ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-memory-model-code-sequences-gfx6-gfx10-table`.

The sequences specify the order of instructions that a single thread must
execute. The ``s_waitcnt`` and ``buffer_wbinvl1_vol`` are defined with respect
to other memory instructions executed by the same thread. This allows them to be
moved earlier or later which can allow them to be combined with other instances
of the same instruction, or hoisted/sunk out of loops to improve
performance. Only the instructions related to the memory model are given;
additional ``s_waitcnt`` instructions are required to ensure registers are
defined before being used. These may be able to be combined with the memory
model ``s_waitcnt`` instructions as described above.

The AMDGPU backend supports the following memory models:

  HSA Memory Model [HSA]_
    The HSA memory model uses a single happens-before relation for all address
    spaces (see :ref:`amdgpu-address-spaces`).
  OpenCL Memory Model [OpenCL]_
    The OpenCL memory model which has separate happens-before relations for the
    global and local address spaces. Only a fence specifying both global and
    local address space, and seq_cst instructions join the relationships. Since
    the LLVM ``memfence`` instruction does not allow an address space to be
    specified the OpenCL fence has to conservatively assume both local and
    global address space was specified. However, optimizations can often be
    done to eliminate the additional ``s_waitcnt`` instructions when there are
    no intervening memory instructions which access the corresponding address
    space. The code sequences in the table indicate what can be omitted for the
    OpenCL memory. The target triple environment is used to determine if the
    source language is OpenCL (see :ref:`amdgpu-opencl`).

``ds/flat_load/store/atomic`` instructions to local memory are termed LDS
operations.

``buffer/global/flat_load/store/atomic`` instructions to global memory are
termed vector memory operations.

For GFX6-GFX9:

* Each agent has multiple shader arrays (SA).
* Each SA has multiple compute units (CU).
* Each CU has multiple SIMDs that execute wavefronts.
* The wavefronts for a single work-group are executed in the same CU but may be
  executed by different SIMDs.
* Each CU has a single LDS memory shared by the wavefronts of the work-groups
  executing on it.
* All LDS operations of a CU are performed as wavefront wide operations in a
  global order and involve no caching. Completion is reported to a wavefront in
  execution order.
* The LDS memory has multiple request queues shared by the SIMDs of a
  CU. Therefore, the LDS operations performed by different wavefronts of a
  work-group can be reordered relative to each other, which can result in
  reordering the visibility of vector memory operations with respect to LDS
  operations of other wavefronts in the same work-group. A ``s_waitcnt
  lgkmcnt(0)`` is required to ensure synchronization between LDS operations and
  vector memory operations between wavefronts of a work-group, but not between
  operations performed by the same wavefront.
* The vector memory operations are performed as wavefront wide operations and
  completion is reported to a wavefront in execution order. The exception is
  that for GFX7-GFX9 ``flat_load/store/atomic`` instructions can report out of
  vector memory order if they access LDS memory, and out of LDS operation order
  if they access global memory.
* The vector memory operations access a single vector L1 cache shared by all
  SIMDs a CU. Therefore, no special action is required for coherence between the
  lanes of a single wavefront, or for coherence between wavefronts in the same
  work-group. A ``buffer_wbinvl1_vol`` is required for coherence between
  wavefronts executing in different work-groups as they may be executing on
  different CUs.
* The scalar memory operations access a scalar L1 cache shared by all wavefronts
  on a group of CUs. The scalar and vector L1 caches are not coherent. However,
  scalar operations are used in a restricted way so do not impact the memory
  model. See :ref:`amdgpu-address-spaces`.
* The vector and scalar memory operations use an L2 cache shared by all CUs on
  the same agent.
* The L2 cache has independent channels to service disjoint ranges of virtual
  addresses.
* Each CU has a separate request queue per channel. Therefore, the vector and
  scalar memory operations performed by wavefronts executing in different
  work-groups (which may be executing on different CUs) of an agent can be
  reordered relative to each other. A ``s_waitcnt vmcnt(0)`` is required to
  ensure synchronization between vector memory operations of different CUs. It
  ensures a previous vector memory operation has completed before executing a
  subsequent vector memory or LDS operation and so can be used to meet the
  requirements of acquire and release.
* The L2 cache can be kept coherent with other agents on some targets, or ranges
  of virtual addresses can be set up to bypass it to ensure system coherence.

For GFX10:

* Each agent has multiple shader arrays (SA).
* Each SA has multiple work-group processors (WGP).
* Each WGP has multiple compute units (CU).
* Each CU has multiple SIMDs that execute wavefronts.
* The wavefronts for a single work-group are executed in the same
  WGP. In CU wavefront execution mode the wavefronts may be executed by
  different SIMDs in the same CU. In WGP wavefront execution mode the
  wavefronts may be executed by different SIMDs in different CUs in the same
  WGP.
* Each WGP has a single LDS memory shared by the wavefronts of the work-groups
  executing on it.
* All LDS operations of a WGP are performed as wavefront wide operations in a
  global order and involve no caching. Completion is reported to a wavefront in
  execution order.
* The LDS memory has multiple request queues shared by the SIMDs of a
  WGP. Therefore, the LDS operations performed by different wavefronts of a
  work-group can be reordered relative to each other, which can result in
  reordering the visibility of vector memory operations with respect to LDS
  operations of other wavefronts in the same work-group. A ``s_waitcnt
  lgkmcnt(0)`` is required to ensure synchronization between LDS operations and
  vector memory operations between wavefronts of a work-group, but not between
  operations performed by the same wavefront.
* The vector memory operations are performed as wavefront wide operations.
  Completion of load/store/sample operations are reported to a wavefront in
  execution order of other load/store/sample operations performed by that
  wavefront.
* The vector memory operations access a vector L0 cache. There is a single L0
  cache per CU. Each SIMD of a CU accesses the same L0 cache. Therefore, no
  special action is required for coherence between the lanes of a single
  wavefront. However, a ``BUFFER_GL0_INV`` is required for coherence between
  wavefronts executing in the same work-group as they may be executing on SIMDs
  of different CUs that access different L0s. A ``BUFFER_GL0_INV`` is also
  required for coherence between wavefronts executing in different work-groups
  as they may be executing on different WGPs.
* The scalar memory operations access a scalar L0 cache shared by all wavefronts
  on a WGP. The scalar and vector L0 caches are not coherent. However, scalar
  operations are used in a restricted way so do not impact the memory model. See
  :ref:`amdgpu-address-spaces`.
* The vector and scalar memory L0 caches use an L1 cache shared by all WGPs on
  the same SA. Therefore, no special action is required for coherence between
  the wavefronts of a single work-group. However, a ``BUFFER_GL1_INV`` is
  required for coherence between wavefronts executing in different work-groups
  as they may be executing on different SAs that access different L1s.
* The L1 caches have independent quadrants to service disjoint ranges of virtual
  addresses.
* Each L0 cache has a separate request queue per L1 quadrant. Therefore, the
  vector and scalar memory operations performed by different wavefronts, whether
  executing in the same or different work-groups (which may be executing on
  different CUs accessing different L0s), can be reordered relative to each
  other. A ``s_waitcnt vmcnt(0) & vscnt(0)`` is required to ensure
  synchronization between vector memory operations of different wavefronts. It
  ensures a previous vector memory operation has completed before executing a
  subsequent vector memory or LDS operation and so can be used to meet the
  requirements of acquire, release and sequential consistency.
* The L1 caches use an L2 cache shared by all SAs on the same agent.
* The L2 cache has independent channels to service disjoint ranges of virtual
  addresses.
* Each L1 quadrant of a single SA accesses a different L2 channel. Each L1
  quadrant has a separate request queue per L2 channel. Therefore, the vector
  and scalar memory operations performed by wavefronts executing in different
  work-groups (which may be executing on different SAs) of an agent can be
  reordered relative to each other. A ``s_waitcnt vmcnt(0) & vscnt(0)`` is
  required to ensure synchronization between vector memory operations of
  different SAs. It ensures a previous vector memory operation has completed
  before executing a subsequent vector memory and so can be used to meet the
  requirements of acquire, release and sequential consistency.
* The L2 cache can be kept coherent with other agents on some targets, or ranges
  of virtual addresses can be set up to bypass it to ensure system coherence.

Private address space uses ``buffer_load/store`` using the scratch V#
(GFX6-GFX8), or ``scratch_load/store`` (GFX9-GFX10). Since only a single thread
is accessing the memory, atomic memory orderings are not meaningful, and all
accesses are treated as non-atomic.

Constant address space uses ``buffer/global_load`` instructions (or equivalent
scalar memory instructions). Since the constant address space contents do not
change during the execution of a kernel dispatch it is not legal to perform
stores, and atomic memory orderings are not meaningful, and all access are
treated as non-atomic.

A memory synchronization scope wider than work-group is not meaningful for the
group (LDS) address space and is treated as work-group.

The memory model does not support the region address space which is treated as
non-atomic.

Acquire memory ordering is not meaningful on store atomic instructions and is
treated as non-atomic.

Release memory ordering is not meaningful on load atomic instructions and is
treated a non-atomic.

Acquire-release memory ordering is not meaningful on load or store atomic
instructions and is treated as acquire and release respectively.

AMDGPU backend only uses scalar memory operations to access memory that is
proven to not change during the execution of the kernel dispatch. This includes
constant address space and global address space for program scope const
variables. Therefore, the kernel machine code does not have to maintain the
scalar L1 cache to ensure it is coherent with the vector L1 cache. The scalar
and vector L1 caches are invalidated between kernel dispatches by CP since
constant address space data may change between kernel dispatch executions. See
:ref:`amdgpu-address-spaces`.

The one exception is if scalar writes are used to spill SGPR registers. In this
case the AMDGPU backend ensures the memory location used to spill is never
accessed by vector memory operations at the same time. If scalar writes are used
then a ``s_dcache_wb`` is inserted before the ``s_endpgm`` and before a function
return since the locations may be used for vector memory instructions by a
future wavefront that uses the same scratch area, or a function call that
creates a frame at the same address, respectively. There is no need for a
``s_dcache_inv`` as all scalar writes are write-before-read in the same thread.

For GFX6-GFX9, scratch backing memory (which is used for the private address
space) is accessed with MTYPE NC_NV (non-coherent non-volatile). Since the
private address space is only accessed by a single thread, and is always
write-before-read, there is never a need to invalidate these entries from the L1
cache. Hence all cache invalidates are done as ``*_vol`` to only invalidate the
volatile cache lines.

For GFX10, scratch backing memory (which is used for the private address space)
is accessed with MTYPE NC (non-coherent). Since the private address space is
only accessed by a single thread, and is always write-before-read, there is
never a need to invalidate these entries from the L0 or L1 caches.

For GFX10, wavefronts are executed in native mode with in-order reporting of
loads and sample instructions. In this mode vmcnt reports completion of load,
atomic with return and sample instructions in order, and the vscnt reports the
completion of store and atomic without return in order. See ``MEM_ORDERED``
field in :ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-compute_pgm_rsrc1-gfx6-gfx10-table`.

In GFX10, wavefronts can be executed in WGP or CU wavefront execution mode:

* In WGP wavefront execution mode the wavefronts of a work-group are executed
  on the SIMDs of both CUs of the WGP. Therefore, explicit management of the per
  CU L0 caches is required for work-group synchronization. Also accesses to L1
  at work-group scope need to be explicitly ordered as the accesses from
  different CUs are not ordered.
* In CU wavefront execution mode the wavefronts of a work-group are executed on
  the SIMDs of a single CU of the WGP. Therefore, all global memory access by
  the work-group access the same L0 which in turn ensures L1 accesses are
  ordered and so do not require explicit management of the caches for
  work-group synchronization.

See ``WGP_MODE`` field in
:ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-compute_pgm_rsrc1-gfx6-gfx10-table` and
:ref:`amdgpu-target-features`.

On dGPU the kernarg backing memory is accessed as UC (uncached) to avoid needing
to invalidate the L2 cache. For GFX6-GFX9, this also causes it to be treated as
non-volatile and so is not invalidated by ``*_vol``. On APU it is accessed as CC
(cache coherent) and so the L2 cache will be coherent with the CPU and other
agents.

Trap Handler ABI
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For code objects generated by AMDGPU backend for HSA [HSA]_ compatible runtimes
(such as ROCm [AMD-ROCm]_), the runtime installs a trap handler that supports
the ``s_trap`` instruction with the following usage:

.. _amdgpu-amdhsa-function-call-convention:

Call Convention
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note::

  This section is currently incomplete and has inaccuracies. It is WIP that will
  be updated as information is determined.

See :ref:`amdgpu-dwarf-address-space-identifier` for information on swizzled
addresses. Unswizzled addresses are normal linear addresses.

.. _amdgpu-amdhsa-function-call-convention-kernel-functions:

Kernel Functions
++++++++++++++++

This section describes the call convention ABI for the outer kernel function.

See :ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-initial-kernel-execution-state` for the kernel call
convention.

The following is not part of the AMDGPU kernel calling convention but describes
how the AMDGPU implements function calls:

1.  Clang decides the kernarg layout to match the *HSA Programmer's Language
    Reference* [HSA]_.

    - All structs are passed directly.
    - Lambda values are passed *TBA*.

    .. TODO::

      - Does this really follow HSA rules? Or are structs >16 bytes passed
        by-value struct?
      - What is ABI for lambda values?

4.  The kernel performs certain setup in its prolog, as described in
    :ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-kernel-prolog`.

.. _amdgpu-amdhsa-function-call-convention-non-kernel-functions:

Non-Kernel Functions
++++++++++++++++++++

This section describes the call convention ABI for functions other than the
outer kernel function.

If a kernel has function calls then scratch is always allocated and used for
the call stack which grows from low address to high address using the swizzled
scratch address space.

On entry to a function:

1.  SGPR0-3 contain a V# with the following properties (see
    :ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-kernel-prolog-private-segment-buffer`):

    * Base address pointing to the beginning of the wavefront scratch backing
      memory.
    * Swizzled with dword element size and stride of wavefront size elements.

2.  The FLAT_SCRATCH register pair is setup. See
    :ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-kernel-prolog-flat-scratch`.
3.  GFX6-8: M0 register set to the size of LDS in bytes. See
    :ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-kernel-prolog-m0`.
4.  The EXEC register is set to the lanes active on entry to the function.
5.  MODE register: *TBD*
6.  VGPR0-31 and SGPR4-29 are used to pass function input arguments as described
    below.
7.  SGPR30-31 return address (RA). The code address that the function must
    return to when it completes. The value is undefined if the function is *no
    return*.
8.  SGPR32 is used for the stack pointer (SP). It is an unswizzled scratch
    offset relative to the beginning of the wavefront scratch backing memory.

    The unswizzled SP can be used with buffer instructions as an unswizzled SGPR
    offset with the scratch V# in SGPR0-3 to access the stack in a swizzled
    manner.

    The unswizzled SP value can be converted into the swizzled SP value by:

      | swizzled SP = unswizzled SP / wavefront size

    This may be used to obtain the private address space address of stack
    objects and to convert this address to a flat address by adding the flat
    scratch aperture base address.

    The swizzled SP value is always 4 bytes aligned for the ``r600``
    architecture and 16 byte aligned for the ``amdgcn`` architecture.

    .. note::

      The ``amdgcn`` value is selected to avoid dynamic stack alignment for the
      OpenCL language which has the largest base type defined as 16 bytes.

    On entry, the swizzled SP value is the address of the first function
    argument passed on the stack. Other stack passed arguments are positive
    offsets from the entry swizzled SP value.

    The function may use positive offsets beyond the last stack passed argument
    for stack allocated local variables and register spill slots. If necessary,
    the function may align these to greater alignment than 16 bytes. After these
    the function may dynamically allocate space for such things as runtime sized
    ``alloca`` local allocations.

    If the function calls another function, it will place any stack allocated
    arguments after the last local allocation and adjust SGPR32 to the address
    after the last local allocation.

9.  All other registers are unspecified.
10. Any necessary ``waitcnt`` has been performed to ensure memory is available
    to the function.

On exit from a function:

1.  VGPR0-31 and SGPR4-29 are used to pass function result arguments as
    described below. Any registers used are considered clobbered registers.
2.  The following registers are preserved and have the same value as on entry:

    * FLAT_SCRATCH
    * EXEC
    * GFX6-8: M0
    * All SGPR registers except the clobbered registers of SGPR4-31.
    * VGPR40-47
      VGPR56-63
      VGPR72-79
      VGPR88-95
      VGPR104-111
      VGPR120-127
      VGPR136-143
      VGPR152-159
      VGPR168-175
      VGPR184-191
      VGPR200-207
      VGPR216-223
      VGPR232-239
      VGPR248-255

        *Except the argument registers, the VGPR clobbered and the preserved
        registers are intermixed at regular intervals in order to
        get a better occupancy.*

      For the AMDGPU backend, an inter-procedural register allocation (IPRA)
      optimization may mark some of clobbered SGPR and VGPR registers as
      preserved if it can be determined that the called function does not change
      their value.

2.  The PC is set to the RA provided on entry.
3.  MODE register: *TBD*.
4.  All other registers are clobbered.
5.  Any necessary ``waitcnt`` has been performed to ensure memory accessed by
    function is available to the caller.

.. TODO::

  - On gfx908 are all ACC registers clobbered?

  - How are function results returned? The address of structured types is passed
    by reference, but what about other types?

The function input arguments are made up of the formal arguments explicitly
declared by the source language function plus the implicit input arguments used
by the implementation.

The source language input arguments are:

1. Any source language implicit ``this`` or ``self`` argument comes first as a
   pointer type.
2. Followed by the function formal arguments in left to right source order.

The source language result arguments are:

1. The function result argument.

The source language input or result struct type arguments that are less than or
equal to 16 bytes, are decomposed recursively into their base type fields, and
each field is passed as if a separate argument. For input arguments, if the
called function requires the struct to be in memory, for example because its
address is taken, then the function body is responsible for allocating a stack
location and copying the field arguments into it. Clang terms this *direct
struct*.

The source language input struct type arguments that are greater than 16 bytes,
are passed by reference. The caller is responsible for allocating a stack
location to make a copy of the struct value and pass the address as the input
argument. The called function is responsible to perform the dereference when
accessing the input argument. Clang terms this *by-value struct*.

A source language result struct type argument that is greater than 16 bytes, is
returned by reference. The caller is responsible for allocating a stack location
to hold the result value and passes the address as the last input argument
(before the implicit input arguments). In this case there are no result
arguments. The called function is responsible to perform the dereference when
storing the result value. Clang terms this *structured return (sret)*.

*TODO: correct the ``sret`` definition.*

.. TODO::

  Is this definition correct? Or is ``sret`` only used if passing in registers, and
  pass as non-decomposed struct as stack argument? Or something else? Is the
  memory location in the caller stack frame, or a stack memory argument and so
  no address is passed as the caller can directly write to the argument stack
  location? But then the stack location is still live after return. If an
  argument stack location is it the first stack argument or the last one?

Lambda argument types are treated as struct types with an implementation defined
set of fields.

.. TODO::

  Need to specify the ABI for lambda types for AMDGPU.

For AMDGPU backend all source language arguments (including the decomposed
struct type arguments) are passed in VGPRs unless marked ``inreg`` in which case
they are passed in SGPRs.

The AMDGPU backend walks the function call graph from the leaves to determine
which implicit input arguments are used, propagating to each caller of the
function. The used implicit arguments are appended to the function arguments
after the source language arguments in the following order:

.. TODO::

  Is recursion or external functions supported?

1.  Work-Item ID (1 VGPR)

    The X, Y and Z work-item ID are packed into a single VGRP with the following
    layout. Only fields actually used by the function are set. The other bits
    are undefined.

    The values come from the initial kernel execution state. See
    :ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-vgpr-register-set-up-order-table`.

    .. table:: Work-item implicit argument layout
      :name: amdgpu-amdhsa-workitem-implicit-argument-layout-table

      ======= ======= ==============
      Bits    Size    Field Name
      ======= ======= ==============

      29:20   10 bits Z Work-Item ID
      31:30   2 bits  Unused
      ======= ======= ==============

2.  Dispatch Ptr (2 SGPRs)

    The value comes from the initial kernel execution state. See
    :ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-sgpr-register-set-up-order-table`.

3.  Queue Ptr (2 SGPRs)

    The value comes from the initial kernel execution state. See
    :ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-sgpr-register-set-up-order-table`.

4.  Kernarg Segment Ptr (2 SGPRs)

    The value comes from the initial kernel execution state. See
    :ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-sgpr-register-set-up-order-table`.

5.  Dispatch id (2 SGPRs)

    The value comes from the initial kernel execution state. See
    :ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-sgpr-register-set-up-order-table`.

6.  Work-Group ID X (1 SGPR)

    The value comes from the initial kernel execution state. See
    :ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-sgpr-register-set-up-order-table`.

7.  Work-Group ID Y (1 SGPR)

    The value comes from the initial kernel execution state. See
    :ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-sgpr-register-set-up-order-table`.

8.  Work-Group ID Z (1 SGPR)

    The value comes from the initial kernel execution state. See
    :ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-sgpr-register-set-up-order-table`.

9.  Implicit Argument Ptr (2 SGPRs)

    The value is computed by adding an offset to Kernarg Segment Ptr to get the
    global address space pointer to the first kernarg implicit argument.

The input and result arguments are assigned in order in the following manner:

.. note::

  There are likely some errors and omissions in the following description that
  need correction.

  .. TODO::

    Check the clang source code to decipher how function arguments and return
    results are handled. Also see the AMDGPU specific values used.

* VGPR arguments are assigned to consecutive VGPRs starting at VGPR0 up to
  VGPR31.

  If there are more arguments than will fit in these registers, the remaining
  arguments are allocated on the stack in order on naturally aligned
  addresses.

  .. TODO::

    How are overly aligned structures allocated on the stack?

* SGPR arguments are assigned to consecutive SGPRs starting at SGPR0 up to
  SGPR29.

  If there are more arguments than will fit in these registers, the remaining
  arguments are allocated on the stack in order on naturally aligned
  addresses.

Note that decomposed struct type arguments may have some fields passed in
registers and some in memory.

.. TODO::

  So, a struct which can pass some fields as decomposed register arguments, will
  pass the rest as decomposed stack elements? But an argument that will not start
  in registers will not be decomposed and will be passed as a non-decomposed
  stack value?

The following is not part of the AMDGPU function calling convention but
describes how the AMDGPU implements function calls:

1.  SGPR33 is used as a frame pointer (FP) if necessary. Like the SP it is an
    unswizzled scratch address. It is only needed if runtime sized ``alloca``
    are used, or for the reasons defined in ``SIFrameLowering``.
2.  Runtime stack alignment is supported. SGPR34 is used as a base pointer (BP)
    to access the incoming stack arguments in the function. The BP is needed
    only when the function requires the runtime stack alignment.

3.  Allocating SGPR arguments on the stack are not supported.

4.  No CFI is currently generated. See
    :ref:`amdgpu-dwarf-call-frame-information`.

    .. note::

      CFI will be generated that defines the CFA as the unswizzled address
      relative to the wave scratch base in the unswizzled private address space
      of the lowest address stack allocated local variable.

      ``DW_AT_frame_base`` will be defined as the swizzled address in the
      swizzled private address space by dividing the CFA by the wavefront size
      (since CFA is always at least dword aligned which matches the scratch
      swizzle element size).

      If no dynamic stack alignment was performed, the stack allocated arguments
      are accessed as negative offsets relative to ``DW_AT_frame_base``, and the
      local variables and register spill slots are accessed as positive offsets
      relative to ``DW_AT_frame_base``.

5.  Function argument passing is implemented by copying the input physical
    registers to virtual registers on entry. The register allocator can spill if
    necessary. These are copied back to physical registers at call sites. The
    net effect is that each function call can have these values in entirely
    distinct locations. The IPRA can help avoid shuffling argument registers.
6.  Call sites are implemented by setting up the arguments at positive offsets
    from SP. Then SP is incremented to account for the known frame size before
    the call and decremented after the call.

    .. note::

      The CFI will reflect the changed calculation needed to compute the CFA
      from SP.

7.  4 byte spill slots are used in the stack frame. One slot is allocated for an
    emergency spill slot. Buffer instructions are used for stack accesses and
    not the ``flat_scratch`` instruction.

    .. TODO::

      Explain when the emergency spill slot is used.

.. TODO::

  Possible broken issues:

  - Stack arguments must be aligned to required alignment.
  - Stack is aligned to max(16, max formal argument alignment)
  - Direct argument < 64 bits should check register budget.
  - Register budget calculation should respect ``inreg`` for SGPR.
  - SGPR overflow is not handled.
  - struct with 1 member unpeeling is not checking size of member.
  - ``sret`` is after ``this`` pointer.
  - Caller is not implementing stack realignment: need an extra pointer.
  - Should say AMDGPU passes FP rather than SP.
  - Should CFI define CFA as address of locals or arguments. Difference is
    apparent when have implemented dynamic alignment.
  - If ``SCRATCH`` instruction could allow negative offsets, then can make FP be
    highest address of stack frame and use negative offset for locals. Would
    allow SP to be the same as FP and could support signal-handler-like as now
    have a real SP for the top of the stack.
  - How is ``sret`` passed on the stack? In argument stack area? Can it overlay
    arguments?

AMDPAL
------

This section provides code conventions used when the target triple OS is
``amdpal`` (see :ref:`amdgpu-target-triples`) for passing runtime parameters
from the application/runtime to each invocation of a hardware shader. These
parameters include both generic, application-controlled parameters called
*user data* as well as system-generated parameters that are a product of the
draw or dispatch execution.

User Data
~~~~~~~~~

Each hardware stage has a set of 32-bit *user data registers* which can be
written from a command buffer and then loaded into SGPRs when waves are launched
via a subsequent dispatch or draw operation. This is the way most arguments are
passed from the application/runtime to a hardware shader.

Compute User Data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Compute shader user data mappings are simpler than graphics shaders and have a
fixed mapping.

Note that there are always 10 available *user data entries* in registers -
entries beyond that limit must be fetched from memory (via the spill table
pointer) by the shader.

  .. table:: PAL Compute Shader User Data Registers
     :name: pal-compute-user-data-registers

     ============= ================================
     User Register Description
     ============= ================================
     0             Global Internal Table (32-bit pointer)
     1             Per-Shader Internal Table (32-bit pointer)
     2 - 11        Application-Controlled User Data (10 32-bit values)
     12            Spill Table (32-bit pointer)
     13 - 14       Thread Group Count (64-bit pointer)
     15            GDS Range
     ============= ================================

Graphics User Data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Graphics pipelines support a much more flexible user data mapping:

  .. table:: PAL Graphics Shader User Data Registers
     :name: pal-graphics-user-data-registers

     ============= ================================
     User Register Description
     ============= ================================
     0             Global Internal Table (32-bit pointer)
     +             Per-Shader Internal Table (32-bit pointer)
     + 1-15        Application Controlled User Data
                   (1-15 Contiguous 32-bit Values in Registers)
     +             Spill Table (32-bit pointer)
     +             Draw Index (First Stage Only)
     +             Vertex Offset (First Stage Only)
     +             Instance Offset (First Stage Only)
     ============= ================================

  The placement of the global internal table remains fixed in the first *user
  data SGPR register*. Otherwise all parameters are optional, and can be mapped
  to any desired *user data SGPR register*, with the following restrictions:

  * Draw Index, Vertex Offset, and Instance Offset can only be used by the first
    active hardware stage in a graphics pipeline (i.e. where the API vertex
    shader runs).

  * Application-controlled user data must be mapped into a contiguous range of
    user data registers.

  * The application-controlled user data range supports compaction remapping, so
    only *entries* that are actually consumed by the shader must be assigned to
    corresponding *registers*. Note that in order to support an efficient runtime
    implementation, the remapping must pack *registers* in the same order as
    *entries*, with unused *entries* removed.

.. _pal_global_internal_table:

Global Internal Table
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The global internal table is a table of *shader resource descriptors* (SRDs)
that define how certain engine-wide, runtime-managed resources should be
accessed from a shader. The majority of these resources have HW-defined formats,
and it is up to the compiler to write/read data as required by the target
hardware.

The following table illustrates the required format:

  .. table:: PAL Global Internal Table
     :name: pal-git-table

     ============= ================================
     Offset        Description
     ============= ================================
     0-3           Graphics Scratch SRD
     4-7           Compute Scratch SRD
     8-11          ES/GS Ring Output SRD
     12-15         ES/GS Ring Input SRD
     16-19         GS/VS Ring Output #0
     20-23         GS/VS Ring Output #1
     24-27         GS/VS Ring Output #2
     28-31         GS/VS Ring Output #3
     32-35         GS/VS Ring Input SRD
     36-39         Tessellation Factor Buffer SRD
     40-43         Off-Chip LDS Buffer SRD
     44-47         Off-Chip Param Cache Buffer SRD
     48-51         Sample Position Buffer SRD
     52            vaRange::ShadowDescriptorTable High Bits
     ============= ================================

  The pointer to the global internal table passed to the shader as user data
  is a 32-bit pointer. The top 32 bits should be assumed to be the same as
  the top 32 bits of the pipeline, so the shader may use the program
  counter's top 32 bits.

Unspecified OS
--------------

This section provides code conventions used when the target triple OS is
empty (see :ref:`amdgpu-target-triples`).

Trap Handler ABI
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For code objects generated by AMDGPU backend for non-amdhsa OS, the runtime does
not install a trap handler. The ``llvm.trap`` and ``llvm.debugtrap``
instructions are handled as follows:

  .. table:: AMDGPU Trap Handler for Non-AMDHSA OS
     :name: amdgpu-trap-handler-for-non-amdhsa-os-table

     =============== =============== ===========================================

.. _amdgpu-opencl:

OpenCL

When the language is OpenCL the following differences occur:

1. The OpenCL memory model is used (see :ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-memory-model`).
2. The AMDGPU backend appends additional arguments to the kernel's explicit
   arguments for the AMDHSA OS (see
   :ref:`opencl-kernel-implicit-arguments-appended-for-amdhsa-os-table`).
3. Additional metadata is generated
   (see :ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-code-object-metadata`).

When the language is HCC the following differences occur:

1. The HSA memory model is used (see :ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-memory-model`).

.. _amdgpu-assembler:

Assembler
---------

AMDGPU backend has LLVM-MC based assembler which is currently in development.
It supports AMDGCN GFX6-GFX10.

This section describes general syntax for instructions and operands.

Instructions
~~~~~~~~~~~~

An instruction has the following :doc:`syntax<AMDGPUInstructionSyntax>`:

  | ``<``\ *opcode*\ ``> <``\ *operand0*\ ``>, <``\ *operand1*\ ``>,...
    <``\ *modifier0*\ ``> <``\ *modifier1*\ ``>...``

:doc:`Operands<AMDGPUOperandSyntax>` are comma-separated while
:doc:`modifiers<AMDGPUModifierSyntax>` are space-separated.

The order of operands and modifiers is fixed.
Most modifiers are optional and may be omitted.

For vector ALU instruction opcodes (VOP1, VOP2, VOP3, VOPC, VOP_DPP, VOP_SDWA),
the assembler will automatically use optimal encoding based on its operands. To
force specific encoding, one can add a suffix to the opcode of the instruction:

* _e32 for 32-bit VOP1/VOP2/VOPC
* _e64 for 64-bit VOP3
* _dpp for VOP_DPP
* _sdwa for VOP_SDWA

Code Object V2 Predefined Symbols (--amdhsa-code-object-version=2)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. warning:: Code Object V2 is not the default code object version emitted by
  this version of LLVM. For a description of the predefined symbols available
  with the default configuration (Code Object V3) see
  :ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-assembler-predefined-symbols-v3`.

The AMDGPU assembler defines and updates some symbols automatically. These
symbols do not affect code generation.

.option.machine_version_major
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Set to the GFX major generation number of the target being assembled for. For
example, when assembling for a "GFX9" target this will be set to the integer
value "9". The possible GFX major generation numbers are presented in
:ref:`amdgpu-processors`.

.option.machine_version_minor
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Set to the GFX minor generation number of the target being assembled for. For
example, when assembling for a "GFX810" target this will be set to the integer
value "1". The possible GFX minor generation numbers are presented in
:ref:`amdgpu-processors`.

.option.machine_version_stepping
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Set to the GFX stepping generation number of the target being assembled for.
For example, when assembling for a "GFX704" target this will be set to the
integer value "4". The possible GFX stepping generation numbers are presented
in :ref:`amdgpu-processors`.

.kernel.vgpr_count
++++++++++++++++++

Set to zero each time a
:ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-assembler-directive-amdgpu_hsa_kernel` directive is
encountered. At each instruction, if the current value of this symbol is less
than or equal to the maximum VGPR number explicitly referenced within that
instruction then the symbol value is updated to equal that VGPR number plus
one.

.kernel.sgpr_count
++++++++++++++++++

Set to zero each time a
:ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-assembler-directive-amdgpu_hsa_kernel` directive is
encountered. At each instruction, if the current value of this symbol is less
than or equal to the maximum VGPR number explicitly referenced within that
instruction then the symbol value is updated to equal that SGPR number plus
one.

Code Object V2 Directives (--amdhsa-code-object-version=2)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. warning:: Code Object V2 is not the default code object version emitted by
  this version of LLVM. For a description of the directives supported with
  the default configuration (Code Object V3) see
  :ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-assembler-directives-v3`.

AMDGPU ABI defines auxiliary data in output code object. In assembly source,
one can specify them with assembler directives.

.hsa_code_object_version major, minor
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

*major* and *minor* are integers that specify the version of the HSA code
object that will be generated by the assembler.

.hsa_code_object_isa [major, minor, stepping, vendor, arch]
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


*major*, *minor*, and *stepping* are all integers that describe the instruction
set architecture (ISA) version of the assembly program.

*vendor* and *arch* are quoted strings. *vendor* should always be equal to
"AMD" and *arch* should always be equal to "AMDGPU".

By default, the assembler will derive the ISA version, *vendor*, and *arch*
from the value of the -mcpu option that is passed to the assembler.

.. _amdgpu-amdhsa-assembler-directive-amdgpu_hsa_kernel:

.amdgpu_hsa_kernel (name)
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

This directives specifies that the symbol with given name is a kernel entry
point (label) and the object should contain corresponding symbol of type
STT_AMDGPU_HSA_KERNEL.

.amd_kernel_code_t
++++++++++++++++++

This directive marks the beginning of a list of key / value pairs that are used
to specify the amd_kernel_code_t object that will be emitted by the assembler.
The list must be terminated by the *.end_amd_kernel_code_t* directive. For any
amd_kernel_code_t values that are unspecified a default value will be used. The
default value for all keys is 0, with the following exceptions:

- *amd_code_version_major* defaults to 1.
- *amd_kernel_code_version_minor* defaults to 2.
- *amd_machine_kind* defaults to 1.
- *amd_machine_version_major*, *machine_version_minor*, and
  *amd_machine_version_stepping* are derived from the value of the -mcpu option
  that is passed to the assembler.
- *kernel_code_entry_byte_offset* defaults to 256.
- *wavefront_size* defaults 6 for all targets before GFX10. For GFX10 onwards
  defaults to 6 if target feature ``wavefrontsize64`` is enabled, otherwise 5.
  Note that wavefront size is specified as a power of two, so a value of **n**
  means a size of 2^ **n**.
- *call_convention* defaults to -1.
- *kernarg_segment_alignment*, *group_segment_alignment*, and
  *private_segment_alignment* default to 4. Note that alignments are specified
  as a power of 2, so a value of **n** means an alignment of 2^ **n**.
- *enable_wgp_mode* defaults to 1 if target feature ``cumode`` is disabled for
  GFX10 onwards.
- *enable_mem_ordered* defaults to 1 for GFX10 onwards.

The *.amd_kernel_code_t* directive must be placed immediately after the
function label and before any instructions.

For a full list of amd_kernel_code_t keys, refer to AMDGPU ABI document,
comments in lib/Target/AMDGPU/AmdKernelCodeT.h and test/CodeGen/AMDGPU/hsa.s.

.. _amdgpu-amdhsa-assembler-symbol-next_free_vgpr:

.amdgcn.next_free_vgpr
++++++++++++++++++++++

Set to zero before assembly begins. At each instruction, if the current value
of this symbol is less than or equal to the maximum VGPR number explicitly
referenced within that instruction then the symbol value is updated to equal
that VGPR number plus one.

May be used to set the `.amdhsa_next_free_vgpr` directive in
:ref:`amdhsa-kernel-directives-table`.

May be set at any time, e.g. manually set to zero at the start of each kernel.

.. _amdgpu-amdhsa-assembler-symbol-next_free_sgpr:

.amdgcn.next_free_sgpr
++++++++++++++++++++++

Set to zero before assembly begins. At each instruction, if the current value
of this symbol is less than or equal the maximum SGPR number explicitly
referenced within that instruction then the symbol value is updated to equal
that SGPR number plus one.

May be used to set the `.amdhsa_next_free_spgr` directive in
:ref:`amdhsa-kernel-directives-table`.

May be set at any time, e.g. manually set to zero at the start of each kernel.

.. _amdgpu-amdhsa-assembler-directives-v3:

Code Object V3 Directives (--amdhsa-code-object-version=3)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Directives which begin with ``.amdgcn`` are valid for all ``amdgcn``
architecture processors, and are not OS-specific. Directives which begin with
``.amdhsa`` are specific to ``amdgcn`` architecture processors when the
``amdhsa`` OS is specified. See :ref:`amdgpu-target-triples` and
:ref:`amdgpu-processors`.

.amdgcn_target <target>
+++++++++++++++++++++++

Optional directive which declares the target supported by the containing
assembler source file. Valid values are described in
:ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-code-object-target-identification`. Used by the assembler
to validate command-line options such as ``-triple``, ``-mcpu``, and those
which specify target features.

.amdhsa_kernel <name>
+++++++++++++++++++++

Creates a correctly aligned AMDHSA kernel descriptor and a symbol,
``<name>.kd``, in the current location of the current section. Only valid when
the OS is ``amdhsa``. ``<name>`` must be a symbol that labels the first
instruction to execute, and does not need to be previously defined.

Marks the beginning of a list of directives used to generate the bytes of a
kernel descriptor, as described in :ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-kernel-descriptor`.
Directives which may appear in this list are described in
:ref:`amdhsa-kernel-directives-table`. Directives may appear in any order, must
be valid for the target being assembled for, and cannot be repeated. Directives
support the range of values specified by the field they reference in
:ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-kernel-descriptor`. If a directive is not specified, it is
assumed to have its default value, unless it is marked as "Required", in which
case it is an error to omit the directive. This list of directives is
terminated by an ``.end_amdhsa_kernel`` directive.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Here is an example of a minimal assembly source file, defining one HSA kernel:

.. code::
   :number-lines:

   .amdgcn_target "amdgcn-amd-amdhsa--gfx900+xnack" // optional

   .text
   .globl hello_world
   .p2align 8
   .type hello_world,@function
   hello_world:
     s_load_dwordx2 s[0:1], s[0:1] 0x0
     v_mov_b32 v0, 3.14159
     s_waitcnt lgkmcnt(0)
     v_mov_b32 v1, s0
     v_mov_b32 v2, s1
     flat_store_dword v[1:2], v0

     .size   hello_world, .Lfunc_end0-hello_world

   .rodata

   .amdhsa_kernel hello_world
     .amdhsa_user_sgpr_kernarg_segment_ptr 1
     .amdhsa_next_free_vgpr .amdgcn.next_free_vgpr

   .end_amdhsa_kernel

     - 0
   amdhsa.kernels:
     - .name: hello_world
       .symbol: hello_world.kd
       .kernarg_segment_size: 48
       .group_segment_fixed_size: 0
       .private_segment_fixed_size: 0

If an assembly source file contains multiple kernels and/or functions, the
:ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-assembler-symbol-next_free_vgpr` and
:ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-assembler-symbol-next_free_sgpr` symbols may be reset using
the ``.set <symbol>, <expression>`` directive. For example, in the case of two
kernels, where ``function1`` is only called from ``kernel1`` it is sufficient
to group the function with the kernel that calls it and reset the symbols
between the two connected components:

.. code::
   :number-lines:

   .amdgcn_target "amdgcn-amd-amdhsa--gfx900+xnack" // optional

   // gpr tracking symbols are implicitly set to zero

   .text
   .globl kern0
   .p2align 8
   .type kern0,@function
   kern0:
     // ...
     s_endpgm
   .Lkern0_end:
     .size   kern0, .Lkern0_end-kern0

   .rodata
   .p2align 6
   .amdhsa_kernel kern0
     // ...
     .amdhsa_next_free_vgpr .amdgcn.next_free_vgpr
     .amdhsa_next_free_sgpr .amdgcn.next_free_sgpr
   .end_amdhsa_kernel

   // reset symbols to begin tracking usage in func1 and kern1
   .set .amdgcn.next_free_vgpr, 0
   .set .amdgcn.next_free_sgpr, 0

   .text
   .hidden func1
   .global func1
   .p2align 2
   .type func1,@function
   func1:
     // ...
     s_setpc_b64 s[30:31]
   .Lfunc1_end:
   .size func1, .Lfunc1_end-func1

   .globl kern1
   .p2align 8
   .type kern1,@function
   kern1:
     // ...
     s_getpc_b64 s[4:5]
     s_add_u32 s4, s4, func1@rel32@lo+4
     s_addc_u32 s5, s5, func1@rel32@lo+4
     s_swappc_b64 s[30:31], s[4:5]
     // ...
     s_endpgm
   .Lkern1_end:
     .size   kern1, .Lkern1_end-kern1

   .rodata
   .p2align 6
   .amdhsa_kernel kern1
     // ...
     .amdhsa_next_free_vgpr .amdgcn.next_free_vgpr
     .amdhsa_next_free_sgpr .amdgcn.next_free_sgpr
   .end_amdhsa_kernel

These symbols cannot identify connected components in order to automatically
track the usage for each kernel. However, in some cases careful organization of
the kernels and functions in the source file means there is minimal additional
effort required to accurately calculate GPR usage.
