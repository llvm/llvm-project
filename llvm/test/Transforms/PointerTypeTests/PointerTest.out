1. Basic pointer operations:
Value of num: 42
Address of num: 0x7ffd4d3a4a3c
Value of ptr: 0x7ffd4d3a4a3c
Value pointed by ptr: 42

2. After dereferencing and modification:
New value of num: 100

3. Pointer arithmetic with array:
First element: 10 at 0x7ffd4d3a4a20
Second element: 20 at 0x7ffd4d3a4a24
Third element: 30 at 0x7ffd4d3a4a28

4. Dynamic memory allocation:
Dynamically allocated value: 200 at 0x55a1f2a6aeb0

5. Pointers and const:
Constant value through pointer: 300

6. Array of pointers:
Pointer 0 points to value: 100
Pointer 1 points to value: 20
Pointer 2 points to value: 200

7. Pointer comparison:
ptr is pointing to num
arrPtr is ahead of arr in memory
