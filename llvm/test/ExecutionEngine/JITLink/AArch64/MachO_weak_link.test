# Check that we can load main.o, which unconditionally uses symbol foo, by
# using -weak_library on a TBD file to emulate forced weak linking against
# a library that supplies foo, but is missing at runtime.
#
# Check that weak linking works for arm64 JIT'd programs even if the TBD
# file contains only an arm64e interface.
