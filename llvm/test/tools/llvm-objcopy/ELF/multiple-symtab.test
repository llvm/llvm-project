## According to the ELF gABI, "Currently, an object file may have only one
## section of each type [SHT_SYMTAB and SHT_DYNSYM], but this restriction may be
## relaxed in the future."
## This test shows that we emit an error if we encounter multiple SHT_SYMTAB
## sections.
# RUN: yaml2obj %s -o %t
# RUN: not llvm-objcopy %t /dev/null 2>&1 | FileCheck %s

# CHECK: error: found multiple SHT_SYMTAB sections
