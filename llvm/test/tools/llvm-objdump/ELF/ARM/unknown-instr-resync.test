# Test that unrecognized instructions are skipped in a way that makes
# sense for the Arm instruction set encoding.
#
# The first three instructions in this file are marked by the mapping
# symbols as in Arm state, with the one in the middle unknown, and we
# expect the disassembler to skip 4 bytes because that's the width of
# any Arm instruction.
#
# At address 0xc there's a mapping symbol that says we're now in Thumb
# mode, and in that mode we include both a 16-bit and a 32-bit unknown
# Thumb instruction, which the disassembler will identify by the simple
# encoding criterion that tells you the instruction length without
# having to recognize it specifically.
#
# Finally we end with a single byte, to ensure nothing gets confused
# when the Thumb instruction stream doesn't contain enough data to
# even do that check.
