; Test that we don't over-count samples for duplicated source code when
; building an IP-based profile.

; The inline-noprobe2.perfbin binary is used for this test because one of the
; partition_pivot_last+3.1 debug locations has a duplication factor of 2
; encoded into its discriminator. In IP-sample mode, a hit in one instruction
; in the duplicated code does not imply a hit to the other duplicates.

; The perfscript input includes 1 sample at a location with duplication factor
; of 2, and another sample at the same source location but with no duplication
; factor. These should be summed without duplication factors. Ensure we record
; a count of 1+1=2 (and not 2+1=3) for the 3.1 location.
