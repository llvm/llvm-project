# After the Optimize exec masking (post-RA) pass, there's a change of having v_cmpx instructions
# being introduced whenever there's a sequence of v_cmp and s_and_saveexec instructions
# which can be safely replaced in various cases.
# However, it is not safe to do so when the generated code sequence would omit part of the EXEC mask
# which could occur when a subset of EXEC is used as input operand in the v_cmp instruction.
# The idea behind this test is to check if the subregisters are correctly handled here.
