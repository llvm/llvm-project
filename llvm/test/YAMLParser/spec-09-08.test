## Note: The parsing rules were changed in version 1.2 and the line-separator
## character is no longer considered a line-break character. The example is
## taken from Spec 1.1 and is now parsed as "..\L .." instead of "..\L\n.." as
## in the original edition.
## See https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/ext/changes/ for details.
