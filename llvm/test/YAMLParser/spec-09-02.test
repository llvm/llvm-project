## Note: The example was originally taken from Spec 1.1, but the parsing rules
## have been changed since then.
## * The paragraph-separator character '\u2029' is excluded from line-break
##   characters, so the original sequence "escaped\t\\\u2029" is no longer
##   considered valid. This is replaced by "escaped\t\\\n" in the test source.
## See https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/ext/changes/ for details.
