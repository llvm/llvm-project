This directory contains TextMate bundles[1] for doing ad-hoc syntax
highlighting of LLVM IR and TableGen files. The highlighting bundles mirror
the syntaxes in the VSCode extension found at /llvm/utils/vscode/llvm. At the
moment, only basic tokens like keywords, comments, and strings are highlighted.

These bundles can be used by the TextMate editor for OS X, as well as other
editors that support them, such as IntelliJ IDEA[2].

To install this bundle, copy it to the per user area:
  cp -R utils/textmate/TableGen.tmbundle \
    ~/Library/Application\ Support/TextMate/Bundles/TableGen.tmbundle

Implementation notes:

The TextMate Syntaxes must use either .tmLanguage or .tmLanguage.json for
IntelliJ IDEA to recognize them. LLVM.tmbundle/Syntaxes/LLVM.tmLanguage.json is
simply a conversion of /llvm/utils/vscode/llvm/syntaxes/ll.tmLanguage.yaml.
