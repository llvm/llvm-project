" LLVM coding guidelines conformance for VIM

" WARNING:    Read before you source in all these commands and macros!  Some
"             of them may change VIM behavior that you depend on.
"
" You can run VIM with these settings without changing your current setup with:
" $ vim -u /path/to/llvm/utils/vim/vimrc

" It's VIM, not VI
set nocompatible

" Wrap text at 80 cols
set textwidth=80

" A tab produces a 2-space indentation
set softtabstop=2
set shiftwidth=2
set expandtab

" Highlight trailing whitespace
highlight WhitespaceEOL ctermbg=DarkYellow guibg=DarkYellow
match WhitespaceEOL /\s\+$/

" Enable filetype detection
filetype on

" Optional
" C/C++ programming helpers
augroup csrc
  au!
  autocmd FileType *      set nocindent smartindent
  autocmd FileType c,cpp  set cindent
augroup END
" Set a few indentation parameters. See the VIM help for cinoptions-values for
" details.  These aren't absolute rules; they're just an approximation of
" common style in LLVM source.
set cinoptions=:0,g0,(0,Ws
" Add and delete spaces in increments of `shiftwidth' for tabs
set smarttab

" Highlight syntax in programming languages
syntax on

" LLVM Makefiles can have names such as Makefile.rules or TEST.nightly.Makefile,
" so it's important to categorize them as such.
augroup filetype
  au! BufRead,BufNewFile *Makefile* set filetype=make
augroup END

" In Makefiles, don't expand tabs to spaces, since we need the actual tabs
autocmd FileType make set noexpandtab

" Useful macros for cleaning up code to conform to LLVM coding guidelines

" Delete trailing whitespace and tabs at the end of each line
command! DeleteTrailingWs :%s/\s\+$//

" Convert all tab characters to two spaces
command! Untab :%s/\t/  /g

" Enable syntax highlighting for LLVM files. To use, copy
" utils/vim/llvm.vim to ~/.vim/syntax .
augroup filetype
  au! BufRead,BufNewFile *.ll     set filetype=llvm
augroup END

" Enable syntax highlighting for tablegen files. To use, copy
" utils/vim/tablegen.vim to ~/.vim/syntax .
augroup filetype
  au! BufRead,BufNewFile *.td     set filetype=tablegen
augroup END
