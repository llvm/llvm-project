## Tests glob pattern handling in the mkdir command.

## This mkdir should fail because the `example_file*.input`s are regular files.
# RUN: not mkdir %S/example_file*.input

# RUN: mkdir %S/example_dir1.new
# RUN: mkdir %S/example_dir2.new

## This mkdir should succeed (so RUN should fail) because the `example_dir*.news` that already exist are directories.
# RUN: not mkdir %S/example_dir*.new
