/// This file declares `DWARFCFIAnalysis` class.
/// `DWARFCFIAnalysis` is a minimal implementation of a DWARF CFI checker
/// described in this link:
/// https://discourse.llvm.org/t/rfc-dwarf-cfi-validation/86936
///
/// The goal of the checker is to validate DWARF CFI directives using the
/// prologue directives and the machine instructions. The main proposed
/// algorithm validates the directives by comparing the CFI state in each
/// instruction with the state achieved by abstract execution of the instruction
/// on the CFI state. However, the current version implemented here is a simple
/// conditional check based on the registers modified by each instruction.

/// `DWARFCFIAnalysis` validates the DWARF Call Frame Information one machine
/// instruction at a time. This class maintains an internal CFI state
/// initialized with the prologue directives and updated with each instruction's
/// associated directives. In each update, it checks if the machine
/// instruction changes the CFI state in a way that matches the changes
/// from the CFI directives. This checking may results in errors and warnings.
///
/// In current stage, the analysis is only aware of what registers the
/// instruction modifies. If the modification is happening to a sub-register,
/// the analysis considers the super-register is modified.
///
/// In each update, for each register (or CFA), the following cases can happen:
/// 1. The unwinding rule is not changed:
///   a. The registers involved in this rule are not modified: the analysis
///      proceeds without emitting error or warning.
///   b. The registers involved in this rule are modified: it emits an error.
/// 2. The unwinding rule is changed:
///   a. The rule is structurally modified (i.e., the location is changed): It
///      emits a warning.
///   b. The rule is structurally the same, but the register set is changed: it
///      emits a warning.
///   c. The rule is structurally the same, using the same set of registers, but
///      the offset is changed:
///      i. If the registers included in the rule are modified as well: It
///         emits a warning.
///     ii. If the registers included in the rule are not modified: It emits an
///         error.
///
/// The analysis only checks the CFA unwinding rule when the rule is a register
/// plus some offset. Therefore, for CFA, only cases 1, 2.b, and 2.c are
/// checked, and in all other case(s), a warning is emitted.
