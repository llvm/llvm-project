/// A unified CAS nodes and key-value database, using on-disk storage for both.
/// It manages storage growth and provides APIs for garbage collection.
///
/// High-level properties:
/// * While \p UnifiedOnDiskCache is open on a directory, by any process, the
///   storage size in that directory will keep growing unrestricted. For data to
///   become eligible for garbage-collection there should be no open instances
///   of \p UnifiedOnDiskCache for that directory, by any process.
/// * Garbage-collection needs to be triggered explicitly by the client. It can
///   be triggered on a directory concurrently, at any time and by any process,
///   without affecting any active readers/writers, in the same process or other
///   processes.
///
/// Usage patterns should be that an instance of \p UnifiedOnDiskCache is open
/// for a limited period of time, e.g. for the duration of a build operation.
/// For long-living processes that need periodic access to a
/// \p UnifiedOnDiskCache, the client should devise a scheme where access is
/// performed within some defined period. For example, if a service is designed
/// to continuously wait for requests that access a \p UnifiedOnDiskCache, it
/// could keep the instance alive while new requests are coming in but close it
/// after a time period in which there are no new requests.
