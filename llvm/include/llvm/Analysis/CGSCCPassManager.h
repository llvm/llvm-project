/// This header provides classes for managing passes over SCCs of the call
/// graph. These passes form an important component of LLVM's interprocedural
/// optimizations. Because they operate on the SCCs of the call graph, and they
/// traverse the graph in post-order, they can effectively do pair-wise
/// interprocedural optimizations for all call edges in the program while
/// incrementally refining it and improving the context of these pair-wise
/// optimizations. At each call site edge, the callee has already been
/// optimized as much as is possible. This in turn allows very accurate
/// analysis of it for IPO.
///
/// A secondary more general goal is to be able to isolate optimization on
/// unrelated parts of the IR module. This is useful to ensure our
/// optimizations are principled and don't miss oportunities where refinement
/// of one part of the module influence transformations in another part of the
/// module. But this is also useful if we want to parallelize the optimizations
/// across common large module graph shapes which tend to be very wide and have
/// large regions of unrelated cliques.
///
/// To satisfy these goals, we use the LazyCallGraph which provides two graphs
/// nested inside each other (and built lazily from the bottom-up): the call
/// graph proper, and a reference graph. The reference graph is super set of
/// the call graph and is a conservative approximation of what could through
/// scalar or CGSCC transforms *become* the call graph. Using this allows us to
/// ensure we optimize functions prior to them being introduced into the call
/// graph by devirtualization or other technique, and thus ensures that
/// subsequent pair-wise interprocedural optimizations observe the optimized
/// form of these functions. The (potentially transitive) reference
/// reachability used by the reference graph is a conservative approximation
/// that still allows us to have independent regions of the graph.
///
/// FIXME: There is one major drawback of the reference graph: in its naive
/// form it is quadratic because it contains a distinct edge for each
/// (potentially indirect) reference, even if are all through some common
/// global table of function pointers. This can be fixed in a number of ways
/// that essentially preserve enough of the normalization. While it isn't
/// expected to completely preclude the usability of this, it will need to be
/// addressed.
///
///
/// All of these issues are made substantially more complex in the face of
/// mutations to the call graph while optimization passes are being run. When
/// mutations to the call graph occur we want to achieve two different things:
///
/// - We need to update the call graph in-flight and invalidate analyses
///   cached on entities in the graph. Because of the cache-based analysis
///   design of the pass manager, it is essential to have stable identities for
///   the elements of the IR that passes traverse, and to invalidate any
///   analyses cached on these elements as the mutations take place.
///
/// - We want to preserve the incremental and post-order traversal of the
///   graph even as it is refined and mutated. This means we want optimization
///   to observe the most refined form of the call graph and to do so in
///   post-order.
///
/// To address this, the CGSCC manager uses both worklists that can be expanded
/// by passes which transform the IR, and provides invalidation tests to skip
/// entries that become dead. This extra data is provided to every SCC pass so
/// that it can carefully update the manager's traversal as the call graph
/// mutates.
///
/// We also provide support for running function passes within the CGSCC walk,
/// and there we provide automatic update of the call graph including of the
/// pass manager to reflect call graph changes that fall out naturally as part
/// of scalar transformations.
///
/// The patterns used to ensure the goals of post-order visitation of the fully
/// refined graph:
///
/// 1) Sink toward the "bottom" as the graph is refined. This means that any
///    iteration continues in some valid post-order sequence after the mutation
///    has altered the structure.
///
/// 2) Enqueue in post-order, including the current entity. If the current
///    entity's shape changes, it and everything after it in post-order needs
///    to be visited to observe that shape.
