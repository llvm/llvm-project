# Offload New API

This directory contains the implementation of the experimental work-in-progress
new API for Offload. It builds on top of the existing plugin implementations but
provides a single level of abstraction suitable for runtimes for languages other
than OpenMP to be built on top of.

See the [API definition readme](API/README.md) for implementation details.
