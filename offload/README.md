# The LLVM/Offload Subproject

The Offload subproject aims at providing tooling, runtimes, and APIs that allow
users to execute code on accelerators or other "co-processors" that may or may
not match the architecture of their "host". In the long run, all kinds of
targets are in scope of this effort, including but not limited to: CPUs, GPUs,
FPGAs, AI/ML accelerators, distributed resources, etc.

The project is just starting and the design is still not ironed out. More
content will show up here and on our webpage soon. In the meantime people are
encouraged to participate in our meetings (see below) and check our
[development board](https://github.com/orgs/llvm/projects/24/) as well as the
discussions on [Discourse](https://discourse.llvm.org/tag/offload).
