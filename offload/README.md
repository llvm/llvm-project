# The LLVM/Offload Subproject

The Offload subproject aims at providing tooling, runtimes, and APIs that allow
users to execute code on accelerators or other "co-processors" that may or may
not match the architecture of their "host". In the long run, all kinds of
targets are in scope of this effort, including but not limited to: CPUs, GPUs,
FPGAs, AI/ML accelerators, distributed resources, etc.

For OpenMP offload users, the project is ready and fully usable.
The final API design is still under development. More content will show up here 
and on our webpage soon. In the meantime, people are encouraged to participate 
in our meetings (see below) and check our
[development board](https://github.com/orgs/llvm/projects/24/) as well as the
discussions on [Discourse](https://discourse.llvm.org/tag/offload).
