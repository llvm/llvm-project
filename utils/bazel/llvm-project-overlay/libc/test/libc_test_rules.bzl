"""LLVM libc starlark rules for tests.

libc functions are created though the libc_build_rules.bzl:libc_function.
They come in two flavors:
 - the internal one that is scoped into the `LIBC_NAMESPACE` namespace.
 - the libc one that is the regular C function.

When performing tests we make sure to always use the internal version.
