    This pass rrewrites `memref.extract_strided_metadata` operations
    targeting the AMDGPU dialect casts.

    The patterns in this pass should normally be run alongside those in
    -expand-strided-metadata, and creating a pass that combines those two
    sets of patterns is the recommended way to use this functionality.
    However, this pass (which will likely need a second -expand-strided-metadata
    after it) is provided so that simple usecases do not need to create custom passes.
    These patterns have not been added to -expnad-strided-metadata to
    prevent the memref dialect from depending on platform-specific code.

  let description = [{
    This pass creates a transfer read op lowering. A vector trasfer read op
    will be lowered to a combination of vector.load, arith.select and
    vector.broadcast.

    This pattern will make it possible for masked transfer_read to be lowered
    towards buffer load with bounds check, allowing a more optimized global
    load accessing pattern compared with existing implementation of
    llvm.intr.masked.load on vectors.
