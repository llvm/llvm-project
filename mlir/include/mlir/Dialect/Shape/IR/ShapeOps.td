    An operation that computes the least general shape of input operands. This
    effectively asserts that corresponding static dimensions are equal. The
    behavior is to match each element of the `shape.type` and propagate the most
    restrictive information, returning an invalid shape if there are
    contradictory requirements. E.g., using pseudo code

    ```
    shape.join([*], [*]) -> [*]
    shape.join([*], [1, ?]) -> [1, ?]
    shape.join([1, 2], [1, ?]) -> [1, 2]

    shape.join([], [*]) -> []
    shape.join([], [?, ?]) -> [invalid]
    shape.join([1, ?], [2, ?, ?]) -> [invalid]
    ```

    `shape.join` also allows specifying an optional error string, that may be
    used to return an error to the user upon mismatch of dimensions.

    ```mlir
    %c = shape.join %a, %b, error="<reason>" : !shape.type

    for (int i = 0, e = shape.rank(); i != e; ++i) {
      res = fn(i, shape[i], res[0], ..., res[n]);
    }

    last computed output of the reduce function. As an example, computing the
    number of elements

      %0 = "shape.constant_dim"() {value = 1 : i32} : () -> !shape.size

    dynamic number of leading dimensions.

    Examples:
