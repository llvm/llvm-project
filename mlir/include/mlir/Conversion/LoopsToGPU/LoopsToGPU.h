/// 1) The loop nest must contain as many perfectly nested loops as the number
/// of values passed in through `numWorkGroups`. This corresponds to the number
/// of grid dimensions of the launch. All loops within the loop nest must be
/// parallel.
/// 2) The body of the innermost loop of the above perfectly nested loops, must
/// contain statements that satisfy one of the two conditions below:
///   a) A perfect loop nest of depth greater than or equal to the number of
///   values passed in through `workGroupSizes`, i.e. the number of thread
///   dimensions of the launch. Loops at depth less than or equal to size of
///   `workGroupSizes` must be parallel. Loops nested deeper can be sequential
///   and are retained as such in the generated GPU launch code.
///   b) Statements that are safe to be executed by all threads within the
///   workgroup. No checks are performed that this is indeed the case.
///   TODO(ravishankarm) : Add checks that verify 2(b) above.
/// The above conditions are assumed to be satisfied by the computation rooted
