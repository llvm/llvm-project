# Interfaces

MLIR is generic and very extensible; it allows for opaquely representing many
different dialects that have their own operations, attributes, types, and so on.
This allows for dialects to be very expressive in their semantics and for MLIR
to capture many different levels of abstraction. The downside to this is that
transformations and analyses must be extremely conservative about the operations
that they encounter, and must special-case the different dialects that they
support. To combat this, MLIR provides the concept of `interfaces`.

## Motivation

Interfaces provide a generic way of interacting with the IR. The goal is to be
able to express transformations/analyses in terms of these interfaces without
encoding specific knowledge about the exact operation or dialect involved. This
makes the compiler more extensible by allowing the addition of new dialects and
operations in a decoupled way with respect to the implementation of
transformations/analyses.

### Dialect Interfaces

Dialect interfaces are generally useful for transformation passes or analyses
that want to opaquely operate on operations, even *across* dialects. These
interfaces generally involve wide coverage over the entire dialect and are only
used for a handful of transformations/analyses. In these cases, registering the
interface directly on each operation is overly complex and cumbersome. The
interface is not core to the operation, just to the specific transformation. An
example of where this type of interface would be used is inlining. Inlining
generally queries high-level information about the operations within a dialect,
like legality and cost modeling, that often is not specific to one operation.

A dialect interface can be defined by inheriting from the CRTP base class
`DialectInterfaceBase::Base`. This class provides the necessary utilities for
registering an interface with the dialect so that it can be looked up later.
Once the interface has been defined, dialects can override it using
dialect-specific information. The interfaces defined by a dialect are registered
in a similar mechanism to Attributes, Operations, Types, etc.

```c++
/// Define an Inlining interface to allow for dialects to opt-in.
class DialectInlinerInterface :
    public DialectInterface::Base<DialectInlinerInterface> {
public:
  /// Returns true if the given region 'src' can be inlined into the region
  /// 'dest' that is attached to an operation registered to the current dialect.
  /// 'valueMapping' contains any remapped values from within the 'src' region.
  /// This can be used to examine what values will replace entry arguments into
  /// the 'src' region, for example.
  virtual bool isLegalToInline(Region *dest, Region *src,
                               BlockAndValueMapping &valueMapping) const {
    return false;
  }
};

/// Override the inliner interface to add support for inlining affine
/// operations.
struct AffineInlinerInterface : public DialectInlinerInterface {
  /// Affine structures have specific inlining constraints.
  bool isLegalToInline(Region *dest, Region *src,
                       BlockAndValueMapping &valueMapping) const final {
    ...
  }
};

/// Register the interface with the dialect.
AffineDialect::AffineDialect(MLIRContext *context) ... {
  addInterfaces<AffineInlinerInterface>();
}
```

Once registered, these interfaces can be opaquely queried from the dialect by
the transformation/analysis that wants to use them:

```c++
Dialect *dialect = ...;
if (auto *interface = dialect->getInterface<DialectInlinerInterface>())
    ... // The dialect provides this interface.
```

#### DialectInterfaceCollections

An additional utility is provided via DialectInterfaceCollection. This CRTP
class allows for collecting all of the dialects that have registered a given
interface within the context.

```c++
class InlinerInterface : public
    DialectInterfaceCollection<DialectInlinerInterface> {
  /// The hooks for this class mirror the hooks for the DialectInlinerInterface,
  /// with default implementations that call the hook on the interface for a
  /// given dialect.
  virtual bool isLegalToInline(Region *dest, Region *src,
                               BlockAndValueMapping &valueMapping) const {
    auto *handler = getInterfaceFor(dest->getContainingOp());
    return handler ? handler->isLegalToInline(dest, src, valueMapping) : false;
  }
};

MLIRContext *ctx = ...;
InlinerInterface interface(ctx);
if(!interface.isLegalToInline(...))
   ...
```

### Operation Interfaces

Operation interfaces, as the name suggests, are those registered at the
Operation level. These interfaces provide an opaque view into derived operations
by providing a virtual interface that must be implemented. As an example, the
`Linalg` dialect may implement an interface that provides general queries about
some of the dialects library operations. These queries may provide things like:
the number of parallel loops; the number of inputs and outputs; etc.

Operation interfaces are defined by overriding the CRTP base class
`OpInterface`. This class takes, as a template parameter, a `Traits` class that
defines a `Concept` and a `Model` class. These classes provide an implementation
of concept-based polymorphism, where the Concept defines a set of virtual
methods that are overridden by the Model that is templated on the concrete
operation type. It is important to note that these classes should be pure in
that they contain no non-static data members. Operations that wish to override
this interface should add the provided trait `OpInterface<..>::Trait` upon
registration.

```c++
struct ExampleOpInterfaceTraits {
  /// Define a base concept class that defines the virtual interface that needs
  /// to be overridden.
  struct Concept {
    virtual ~Concept();
    virtual unsigned getNumInputs(Operation *op) = 0;
  };

  /// Define a model class that specializes a concept on a given operation type.
  template <typename OpT>
  struct Model : public Concept {
    /// Override the method to dispatch on the concrete operation.
    unsigned getNumInputs(Operation *op) final {
      return llvm::cast<OpT>(op).getNumInputs();
    }
  };
};

class ExampleOpInterface : public OpInterface<ExampleOpInterface,
                                              ExampleOpInterfaceTraits> {
public:
  /// Use base class constructor to support LLVM-style casts.
  using OpInterface<ExampleOpInterface, ExampleOpInterfaceTraits>::OpInterface;

  /// The interface dispatches to 'getImpl()', an instance of the concept.
  unsigned getNumInputs() {
    return getImpl()->getNumInputs(getOperation());
  }
};

```

Once the interface has been defined, it is registered to an operation by adding
the provided trait `ExampleOpInterface::Trait`. Using this interface is just
like using any other derived operation type, i.e. casting:

```c++
/// When defining the operation, the interface is registered via the nested
/// 'Trait' class provided by the 'OpInterface<>' base class.
class MyOp : public Op<MyOp, ExampleOpInterface::Trait> {
public:
  /// The definition of the interface method on the derived operation.
  unsigned getNumInputs() { return ...; }
};

/// Later, we can query if a specific operation(like 'MyOp') overrides the given
/// interface.
Operation *op = ...;
if (ExampleOpInterface example = dyn_cast<ExampleOpInterface>(op))
  llvm::errs() << "num inputs = " << example.getNumInputs() << "\n";
```

#### Utilizing the ODS Framework

Operation interfaces require a bit of boiler plate to connect all of the pieces
together. The ODS(Operation Definition Specification) framework provides
simplified mechanisms for
[defining interfaces](OpDefinitions.md#operation-interfaces).

As an example, using the ODS framework would allow for defining the example
interface above as:

```tablegen
def ExampleOpInterface : OpInterface<"ExampleOpInterface"> {
  let description = [{
    This is an example interface definition.
  }];

  let methods = [
    InterfaceMethod<
      "Get the number of inputs for the current operation.",
      "unsigned", "getNumInputs"
    >,
  ];
}
```
