# The registry source file ends up generating a lot of sections for each
# matcher. Each matcher appears to get a vtable and several methods. Each
# method needs .text, .pdata, .xdata, and .debug sections, adding to the
# section multiplier. By default MSVC has a 2^16 limit on the number of
# sections in an object file, and this needs more than that.
