README_amd_driver_trunk_diffs
=============================

There is an effort to minimize the differences between the upstream LLVM trunk
Driver code and the Driver code for the downstream amd-staging branch.
This readme discusses the Driver differences found in these directories:

   llvm-project/clang/lib/Driver 
   llvm-project/clang/include/clang/Driver 

Efforts should be made to minimize trunk differences in upstream files by
putting non-upstream functions in different filenames, if that is possible.
Some effort to do this has already started in some of the below listed
subsystems. 

These are the areas where amd-staging differs from the trunk:

- Support for legacy/classic flang driver.  This will eventually go away
  when llvm flang (flang) is in production. 

- Support for the generation of parallel jobs. Unless someone upstreams 
  this support, this difference will remain.

- Support for --opaque-offload-linker. This using the same offload driver, actions
  and phases. It is only an alternative command generator in ToolChains/Clang.cpp 
  LinerWrapper:ConstructJob. Instead of the driver generating four commands
  (unpackage, clang-linker-wrapper, clang driver, and ld.lld), this option generates 
  a debugable set of 9 commands that allows the developer to intercept, analyze, insert 
  changes, and test changes to the various steps that are managed in memory 
  by clang-linker-wrapper. The file ToolChains/OpaqueOffloadLinker.cpp contains
  the driver support for this option. 
 
- Support for the old Driver and bundle/unbundle in HIP toolchain.  This difference
  may be removed when HIP supports the new driver which includes packager and
  clang-linker-wrapper.

- Support for openmp bolt runtime.  See https://github.com/pmodels/bolt

- Support for OMPT and OMPD that is not yet upstream. AMD participates in the 
  development of these two OpenMP subsystems. 

- Support for certain optimizations such as cross team reductions and  
   -plugin-opt=-amdgpu-spill-cfi-saved-regs

- Support for AMDGPU Code object version. 

- Support for Static Device Libs (SDL).  This support was introduced by amd
  many years ago. Its definition of sdl and corresponding search methods
  is more generic than the introduction of static device libs by the "new"
  driver in recent years. Both techniques extend host library management
  to support heterogeneous libraries. However, the definition of SDL and 
  library search methods is much broader with the amd implementation. 
  There is a detailed document to describe SDL.
