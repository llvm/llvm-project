<h1>Filing Bugs and Feature Requests</h1>

<p>We encourage users to file bug reports for any problems that they encounter.
We also welcome feature requests. When filing a bug report, please do the
following:</p>

<ul>

<li>Include the checker build (for prebuilt Mac OS X binaries) or the git hash.
</li>

<li>Provide a self-contained, reduced test case that exhibits the issue you are
experiencing.</li>

<li>Test cases don't tell us everything. Please briefly describe the problem you
are seeing, including what you thought should have been the expected behavior
and why.</li>

</ul>

<p>Please <a href="https://llvm.org/docs/HowToSubmitABug.html">file
bugs and feature requests</a> in
<a href="https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues">LLVM's issue tracker</a>
and label the report with the <code>clang:static analyzer</code> label.</p>
