# This test demonstrates the new "IncludePath" field.
# This field allows specifying include paths through
# multilib.yaml configuration using relative paths.
# Absolute paths should be rejected by the driver
# with an appropriate diagnostic message.
#
# This test verifies that passing an absolute path
# (/include) to IncludePath triggers the expected
# error.

# # RUN: %clang --target=aarch64-none-elf --multi-lib-config=%s %s -### -o /dev/null 2>&1 \
# RUN: | FileCheck %s --check-prefix=CHECK-ERROR
# CHECK-ERROR: error: paths must be relative but "/include" starts with "/"
