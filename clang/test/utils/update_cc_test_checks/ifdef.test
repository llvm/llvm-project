## Test that functions that are only compiled in a subset of RUN lines are
## handled correctly

# RUN: cp %S/Inputs/ifdef.c %t.c && %update_cc_test_checks %t.c
# RUN: diff -u %S/Inputs/ifdef.c.expected %t.c
## Check that re-running update_cc_test_checks doesn't change the output
# RUN: %update_cc_test_checks %t.c
# RUN: diff -u %S/Inputs/ifdef.c.expected %t.c
