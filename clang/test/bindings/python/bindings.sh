# Hexagon has known test failures that need to be addressed.
# SystemZ has broken Python/FFI interface:

# python SEGVs on Linux/sparc64 when loading libclang.so.  Seems to be an FFI
# issue, too.
# XFAIL: target={{sparc.*-.*-linux.*}}

# Tests will fail if cross-compiling for a different target, as tests will try
# to use the host Python3_EXECUTABLE and make FFI calls to functions in target
# libraries.
#
# FIXME: Consider a solution that allows better control over these tests in
# a crosscompiling scenario. e.g. registering them with lit to allow them to
# be explicitly skipped via appropriate LIT_ARGS, or adding a mechanism to
# allow specifying a python interpreter compiled for the target that could
# be executed using qemu-user.
# REQUIRES: native

# RUN: env PYTHONPATH=%S/../../../bindings/python \
# RUN:   CLANG_LIBRARY_PATH=%libdir \
# RUN:   %python -m unittest discover -s %S/tests
