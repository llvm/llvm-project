TODO: write this once the design is settled (@reviewer, don't look here yet)

CSA enjoys two facilities to collect statistics per translation unit and per entry point.

Mention the following tools:
- STATISTIC macro
- ALLWAYS_ENABLED_STATISTIC macro

- STAT_COUNTER macro
- STAT_MAX macro

- BoolEPStat
- UnsignedEPStat
- CounterEPStat
- UnsignedMaxEPStat

- dump-se-metrics-to-csv="%t.csv"
