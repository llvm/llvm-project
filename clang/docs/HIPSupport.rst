HIP Support
=============

HIP (Heterogeneous-Compute Interface for Portability) `<https://github.com/ROCm-Developer-Tools/HIP>`_ is
a C++ Runtime API and Kernel Language. It enables developers to create portable applications for
offloading computation to different hardware platforms from a single source code.

AMD GPU Support
===============

Clang provides HIP support on AMD GPUs via the ROCm platform `<https://rocm.docs.amd.com/en/latest/#>`_.
The ROCm runtime forms the base for HIP host APIs, while HIP device APIs are realized through HIP header
files and the ROCm device library. The Clang driver uses the HIPAMD toolchain to compile HIP device code
to AMDGPU ISA via the AMDGPU backend. The compiled code is then bundled and embedded in the host executables.

Intel GPU Support
=================

Clang provides partial HIP support on Intel GPUs using the CHIP-Star project `<https://github.com/CHIP-SPV/chipStar>`_.
CHIP-Star implements the HIP runtime over oneAPI Level Zero or OpenCL runtime. The Clang driver uses the HIPSPV
toolchain to compile HIP device code into LLVM IR, which is subsequently translated to SPIR-V via the SPIR-V
backend or the out-of-tree LLVM-SPIRV translator. The SPIR-V is then bundled and embedded into the host executables.

.. note::
   While Clang does not directly provide HIP support for NVIDIA GPUs and CPUs, these platforms are supported via other means:

   - NVIDIA GPUs: HIP support is offered through the HIP project `<https://github.com/ROCm-Developer-Tools/HIP>`_, which provides a header-only library for translating HIP runtime APIs into CUDA runtime APIs. The code is subsequently compiled using NVIDIA's `nvcc`.

   - CPUs: HIP support is available through the HIP-CPU runtime library `<https://github.com/ROCm-Developer-Tools/HIP-CPU>`_. This header-only library enables CPUs to execute unmodified HIP code.


Example Usage
=============

To compile a HIP program, use the following command:

.. code-block:: shell

   clang++ -c --offload-arch=gfx906 -xhip sample.cpp -o sample.o

The ``-xhip`` option indicates that the source is a HIP program. If the file has a ``.hip`` extension,
Clang will automatically recognize it as a HIP program:

.. code-block:: shell

   clang++ -c --offload-arch=gfx906 sample.hip -o sample.o

To link a HIP program, use this command:

.. code-block:: shell

   clang++ --hip-link --offload-arch=gfx906 sample.o -o sample

In the above command, the ``--hip-link`` flag instructs Clang to link the HIP runtime library. However,
the use of this flag is unnecessary if a HIP input file is already present in your program.

For convenience, Clang also supports compiling and linking in a single step:

.. code-block:: shell

   clang++ --offload-arch=gfx906 -xhip sample.cpp -o sample

In the above commands, ``gfx906`` is the GPU architecture that the code is being compiled for. The supported GPU
architectures can be found in the `AMDGPU Processor Table <https://llvm.org/docs/AMDGPUUsage.html#processors>`_.
Alternatively, you can use the ``amdgpu-arch`` tool that comes with Clang to list the GPU architecture on your system:

.. code-block:: shell

   amdgpu-arch

You can use ``--offload-arch=native`` to automatically detect the GPU architectures on your system:

.. code-block:: shell

   clang++ --offload-arch=native -xhip sample.cpp -o sample


Path Setting for Dependencies
=============================

Compiling a HIP program depends on the HIP runtime and device library. The paths to the HIP runtime and device libraries
can be specified either using compiler options or environment variables. The paths can also be set through the ROCm path
if they follow the ROCm installation directory structure.

Order of Precedence for HIP Path
--------------------------------

1. ``--hip-path`` compiler option
2. ``HIP_PATH`` environment variable *(use with caution)*
3. ``--rocm-path`` compiler option
4. ``ROCM_PATH`` environment variable *(use with caution)*
5. Default automatic detection (relative to Clang or at the default ROCm installation location)

Order of Precedence for Device Library Path
-------------------------------------------

1. ``--hip-device-lib-path`` compiler option
2. ``HIP_DEVICE_LIB_PATH`` environment variable *(use with caution)*
3. ``--rocm-path`` compiler option
4. ``ROCM_PATH`` environment variable *(use with caution)*
5. Default automatic detection (relative to Clang or at the default ROCm installation location)

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Compiler Option
     - Environment Variable
     - Description
     - Default Value
   * - ``--rocm-path=<path>``
     - ``ROCM_PATH``
     - Specifies the ROCm installation path.
     - Automatic detection
   * - ``--hip-path=<path>``
     - ``HIP_PATH``
     - Specifies the HIP runtime installation path.
     - Determined by ROCm directory structure
   * - ``--hip-device-lib-path=<path>``
     - ``HIP_DEVICE_LIB_PATH``
     - Specifies the HIP device library installation path.
     - Determined by ROCm directory structure

.. note::

   We recommend using the compiler options as the primary method for specifying these paths. While the environment variables ``ROCM_PATH``, ``HIP_PATH``, and ``HIP_DEVICE_LIB_PATH`` are supported, their use can lead to implicit dependencies that might cause issues in the long run. Use them with caution.
