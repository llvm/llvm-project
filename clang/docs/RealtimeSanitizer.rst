Introduction
============
RealtimeSanitizer (a.k.a. RTSan) is a real-time safety testing tool for C and C++
projects. RTSan can be used to detect real-time violations, i.e. calls to methods
that are not safe for use in functions with deterministic runtime requirements.
RTSan considers any function marked with the ``[[clang::nonblocking]]`` attribute
to be a real-time function. If RTSan detects a call to ``malloc``, ``free``,
``pthread_mutex_lock``, or anything else that could have a non-deterministic
execution time in a function marked ``[[clang::nonblocking]]``
RTSan raises an error.

The runtime slowdown introduced by RealtimeSanitizer is negligible.

How to build
============

Build LLVM/Clang with `CMake <https://llvm.org/docs/CMake.html>` and enable the
``compiler-rt`` runtime. An example CMake configuration that will allow for the
use/testing of RealtimeSanitizer:

.. code-block:: console

   $ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DLLVM_ENABLE_PROJECTS="clang" -DLLVM_ENABLE_RUNTIMES="compiler-rt" <path to source>/llvm

Usage
=====

There are two requirements:

1. The code must be compiled with the ``-fsanitize=realtime`` flag.
2. Functions that are subject to real-time constraints must be marked
   with the ``[[clang::nonblocking]]`` attribute.

Typically, these attributes should be added onto the functions that are entry
points for threads with real-time priority. These threads are subject to a fixed
callback time, such as audio callback threads or rendering loops in video game
code.

.. code-block:: console

   % cat example_realtime_violation.cpp
   #include <vector>

   void violation() [[clang::nonblocking]]{
     std::vector<float> v;
     v.resize(100);
   }

   int main() {
     violation();
     return 0;
   }
   # Compile and link
   % clang++ -fsanitize=realtime -g example_realtime_violation.cpp

If a real-time safety violation is detected in a ``[[clang::nonblocking]]``
context, or any function invoked by that function, the program will exit with a
non-zero exit code.

.. code-block:: console

   % clang++ -fsanitize=realtime -g example_realtime_violation.cpp
   % ./a.out
