Clang Static Analyzer
=====================

The Clang Static Analyzer is a source code analysis tool that finds bugs in C, C++, and Objective-C programs.
It implements *path-sensitive*, *inter-procedural analysis* based on *symbolic execution* technique.

The Static Analyzer is a part of Clang; for downloading and installing Clang visit the `LLVM releases page <https://releases.llvm.org/>`_.

This is the documentation page of the Static Analyzer; there is also an old `Official Tool Page <https://clang-analyzer.llvm.org/>`_ which provides a short overview of features and limitations.
