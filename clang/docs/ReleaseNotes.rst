Introduction
============

This document contains the release notes for the Clang C/C++/Objective-C
frontend, part of the LLVM Compiler Infrastructure, release |release|. Here we
describe the status of Clang in some detail, including major
improvements from the previous release and new feature work. For the
general LLVM release notes, see `the LLVM
documentation <https://llvm.org/docs/ReleaseNotes.html>`_. For the libc++ release notes,
see `this page <https://libcxx.llvm.org/ReleaseNotes.html>`_. All LLVM releases
may be downloaded from the `LLVM releases web site <https://llvm.org/releases/>`_.

For more information about Clang or LLVM, including information about the
latest release, please see the `Clang Web Site <https://clang.llvm.org>`_ or the
`LLVM Web Site <https://llvm.org>`_.

Potentially Breaking Changes
============================
These changes are ones which we think may surprise users when upgrading to
Clang |release| because of the opportunity they pose for disruption to existing
code bases.

C/C++ Language Potentially Breaking Changes
-------------------------------------------

C++ Specific Potentially Breaking Changes
-----------------------------------------

ABI Changes in This Version
---------------------------

AST Dumping Potentially Breaking Changes
----------------------------------------

Clang Frontend Potentially Breaking Changes
-------------------------------------------
- Removed support for constructing on-stack ``TemplateArgumentList``s; interfaces should instead
  use ``ArrayRef<TemplateArgument>`` to pass template arguments. Transitioning internal uses to
  ``ArrayRef<TemplateArgument>`` reduces AST memory usage by 0.4% when compiling clang, and is
  expected to show similar improvements on other workloads.

- The ``-Wgnu-binary-literal`` diagnostic group no longer controls any
  diagnostics. Binary literals are no longer a GNU extension, they're now a C23
  extension which is controlled via ``-pedantic`` or ``-Wc23-extensions``. Use
  of ``-Wno-gnu-binary-literal`` will no longer silence this pedantic warning,
  which may break existing uses with ``-Werror``.

What's New in Clang |release|?
==============================
Some of the major new features and improvements to Clang are listed
here. Generic improvements to Clang as a whole or to its underlying
infrastructure are described first, followed by language-specific
sections with improvements to Clang's support for those languages.

C++ Language Changes
--------------------

C++20 Feature Support
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Clang won't perform ODR checks for decls in the global module fragment any
  more to ease the implementation and improve the user's using experience.
  This follows the MSVC's behavior. Users interested in testing the more strict
  behavior can use the flag '-Xclang -fno-skip-odr-check-in-gmf'.
  (`#79240 <https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues/79240>`_).

- Implemented the `__is_layout_compatible` intrinsic to support
  `P0466R5: Layout-compatibility and Pointer-interconvertibility Traits <https://wg21.link/P0466R5>`_.

C++23 Feature Support
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Implemented `P2718R0: Lifetime extension in range-based for loops <https://wg21.link/P2718R0>`_. Also
  materialize temporary object which is a prvalue in discarded-value expression.

C++2c Feature Support
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Implemented `P2662R3 Pack Indexing <https://wg21.link/P2662R3>`_.


Resolutions to C++ Defect Reports
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- Substitute template parameter pack, when it is not explicitly specified
  in the template parameters, but is deduced from a previous argument.
  (`#78449: <https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues/78449>`_).

- Type qualifications are now ignored when evaluating layout compatibility
  of two types.
  (`CWG1719: Layout compatibility and cv-qualification revisited <https://cplusplus.github.io/CWG/issues/1719.html>`_).

- ``[[no_unique_address]]`` is now respected when evaluating layout
  compatibility of two types.
  (`CWG2759: [[no_unique_address] and common initial sequence  <https://cplusplus.github.io/CWG/issues/2759.html>`_).

C Language Changes
------------------

C23 Feature Support
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- No longer diagnose use of binary literals as an extension in C23 mode. Fixes
  `#72017 <https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues/72017>`_.

- Corrected parsing behavior for the ``alignas`` specifier/qualifier in C23. We
  previously handled it as an attribute as in C++, but there are parsing
  differences. The behavioral differences are:

  .. code-block:: c

     struct alignas(8) /* was accepted, now rejected */ S {
       char alignas(8) /* was rejected, now accepted */ C;
     };
     int i alignas(8) /* was accepted, now rejected */ ;

  Fixes (`#81472 <https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues/81472>`_).

- Clang now generates predefined macros of the form ``__TYPE_FMTB__`` and
  ``__TYPE_FMTb__`` (e.g., ``__UINT_FAST64_FMTB__``) in C23 mode for use with
  macros typically exposed from ``<inttypes.h>``, such as ``PRIb8``.
  (`#81896: <https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues/81896>`_).

Non-comprehensive list of changes in this release
-------------------------------------------------

- Added ``__builtin_readsteadycounter`` for reading fixed frequency hardware
  counters.

- ``__builtin_addc``, ``__builtin_subc``, and the other sizes of those
  builtins are now constexpr and may be used in constant expressions.

New Compiler Flags
------------------

Deprecated Compiler Flags
-------------------------

Modified Compiler Flags
-----------------------

Removed Compiler Flags
-------------------------

- The ``-freroll-loops`` flag has been removed. It had no effect since Clang 13.

Attribute Changes in Clang
--------------------------

Improvements to Clang's diagnostics
-----------------------------------
- Clang now applies syntax highlighting to the code snippets it
  prints.

- Clang now diagnoses member template declarations with multiple declarators.

- Clang now diagnoses use of the ``template`` keyword after declarative nested
  name specifiers.

- The ``-Wshorten-64-to-32`` diagnostic is now grouped under ``-Wimplicit-int-conversion`` instead
   of ``-Wconversion``. Fixes `#69444 <https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues/69444>`_.

- Clang now diagnoses friend declarations with an ``enum`` elaborated-type-specifier in language modes after C++98.

- Added diagnostics for C11 keywords being incompatible with language standards
  before C11, under a new warning group: ``-Wpre-c11-compat``.

- Now diagnoses an enumeration constant whose value is larger than can be
  represented by ``unsigned long long``, which can happen with a large constant
  using the ``wb`` or ``uwb`` suffix. The maximal underlying type is currently
  ``unsigned long long``, but this behavior may change in the future when Clang
  implements
  `WG14 N3029 <https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n3029.htm>`_.
  Fixes `#69352 <https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues/69352>`_.

- Clang now diagnoses extraneous template parameter lists as a language extension.

- Clang now diagnoses declarative nested name specifiers that name alias templates.

Improvements to Clang's time-trace
----------------------------------

Bug Fixes in This Version
-------------------------
- Fixed missing warnings when comparing mismatched enumeration constants
  in C (`#29217 <https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues/29217>`).

- Clang now accepts elaborated-type-specifiers that explicitly specialize
  a member class template for an implicit instantiation of a class template.

- Fixed missing warnings when doing bool-like conversions in C23 (`#79435 <https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues/79435>`_).
- Clang's ``-Wshadow`` no longer warns when an init-capture is named the same as
  a class field unless the lambda can capture this.
  Fixes (`#71976 <https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues/71976>`_)

- Clang now accepts qualified partial/explicit specializations of variable templates that
  are not nominable in the lookup context of the specialization.

- Clang now doesn't produce false-positive warning `-Wconstant-logical-operand`
  for logical operators in C23.
  Fixes (`#64356 <https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues/64356>`_).

- Fixed an issue where template parameters of a nested abbreviated generic lambda within
  a requires-clause lie at the same depth as those of the surrounding lambda. This,
  in turn, results in the wrong template argument substitution during constraint checking.
  (`#78524 <https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues/78524>`_)
- Clang no longer instantiates the exception specification of discarded candidate function
  templates when determining the primary template of an explicit specialization.

Bug Fixes to AST Handling
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Miscellaneous Bug Fixes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Miscellaneous Clang Crashes Fixed
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

OpenACC Specific Changes
------------------------

Target Specific Changes
-----------------------

AMDGPU Support
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

X86 Support
^^^^^^^^^^^

Arm and AArch64 Support
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- ARMv7+ targets now default to allowing unaligned access, except Armv6-M, and
  Armv8-M without the Main Extension. Baremetal targets should check that the
  new default will work with their system configurations, since it requires
  that SCTLR.A is 0, SCTLR.U is 1, and that the memory in question is
  configured as "normal" memory. This brings Clang in-line with the default
  settings for GCC and Arm Compiler. Aside from making Clang align with other
  compilers, changing the default brings major performance and code size
  improvements for most targets. We have not changed the default behavior for
  ARMv6, but may revisit that decision in the future. Users can restore the old
  behavior with -m[no-]unaligned-access.

Android Support
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Windows Support
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

LoongArch Support
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

RISC-V Support
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- ``__attribute__((rvv_vector_bits(N)))`` is now supported for RVV vbool*_t types.

  textual and JSON dumping for various ``TypeLoc``-related nodes.

Moved checkers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. _release-notes-sanitizers:

Sanitizers
----------

- ``-fsanitize=signed-integer-overflow`` now instruments signed arithmetic even
  when ``-fwrapv`` is enabled. Previously, only division checks were enabled.

  Users with ``-fwrapv`` as well as a sanitizer group like
  ``-fsanitize=undefined`` or ``-fsanitize=integer`` enabled may want to
  manually disable potentially noisy signed integer overflow checks with
  ``-fno-sanitize=signed-integer-overflow``

Python Binding Changes
----------------------

- Exposed `CXRewriter` API as `class Rewriter`.
