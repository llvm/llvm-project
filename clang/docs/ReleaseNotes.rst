describe the status of Clang in some detail, including major
improvements from the previous release and new feature work. For the
general LLVM release notes, see `the LLVM
documentation <https://llvm.org/docs/ReleaseNotes.html>`_. All LLVM
releases may be downloaded from the `LLVM releases web

- Option ``SpacesInLineCommentPrefix`` has been added to control the
  number of spaces in a line comments prefix.

- Option ``SortIncludes`` has been updated from a ``bool`` to an
  ``enum`` with backwards compatibility. In addition to the previous
  ``true``/``false`` states (now ``CaseInsensitive``/``Never``), a third
  state has been added (``CaseSensitive``) which causes an alphabetical sort
  with case used as a tie-breaker.

  .. code-block:: c++

    // Never (previously false)
    #include "B/A.h"
    #include "A/B.h"
    #include "a/b.h"
    #include "A/b.h"
    #include "B/a.h"

    // CaseInsensitive (previously true)
    #include "A/B.h"
    #include "A/b.h"
    #include "B/A.h"
    #include "B/a.h"
    #include "a/b.h"

    // CaseSensitive
    #include "A/B.h"
    #include "A/b.h"
    #include "a/b.h"
    #include "B/A.h"
    #include "B/a.h"

- ``BasedOnStyle: InheritParentConfig`` allows to use the ``.clang-format`` of
  the parent directories to overwrite only parts of it.
