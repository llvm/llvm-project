What's New in Clang 12.0.0?
===========================

Some of the major new features and improvements to Clang are listed
here. Generic improvements to Clang as a whole or to its underlying
infrastructure are described first, followed by language-specific
sections with improvements to Clang's support for those languages.

Major New Features
------------------

- ...

Improvements to Clang's diagnostics
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- ...

Non-comprehensive list of changes in this release
-------------------------------------------------

- The builtin intrinsics ``__builtin_bitreverse8``, ``__builtin_bitreverse16``,
  ``__builtin_bitreverse32`` and ``__builtin_bitreverse64`` may now be used
  within constant expressions.

- The builtin intrinsics ``__builtin_rotateleft8``, ``__builtin_rotateleft16``,
  ``__builtin_rotateleft32`` and ``__builtin_rotateleft64`` may now be used
  within constant expressions.

- The builtin intrinsics ``__builtin_rotateright8``, ``__builtin_rotateright16``,
  ``__builtin_rotateright32`` and ``__builtin_rotateright64`` may now be used
  within constant expressions.

New Compiler Flags
------------------

- ...

- -fpch-codegen and -fpch-debuginfo generate shared code and/or debuginfo
  for contents of a precompiled header in a separate object file. This object
  file needs to be linked in, but its contents do not need to be generated
  for other objects using the precompiled header. This should usually save
  compile time. If not using clang-cl, the separate object file needs to
  be created explicitly from the precompiled header.
  Example of use:

  .. code-block:: console

    $ clang++ -x c++-header header.h -o header.pch -fpch-codegen -fpch-debuginfo
    $ clang++ -c header.pch -o shared.o
    $ clang++ -c source.cpp -o source.o -include-pch header.pch
    $ clang++ -o binary source.o shared.o

  - Using -fpch-instantiate-templates when generating the precompiled header
    usually increases the amount of code/debuginfo that can be shared.
  - In some cases, especially when building with optimizations enabled, using
    -fpch-codegen may generate so much code in the shared object that compiling
    it may be a net loss in build time.
  - Since headers may bring in private symbols of other libraries, it may be
    sometimes necessary to discard unused symbols (such as by adding
    -Wl,--gc-sections on ELF platforms to the linking command, and possibly
    adding -fdata-sections -ffunction-sections to the command generating
    the shared object).

Deprecated Compiler Flags
-------------------------

The following options are deprecated and ignored. They will be removed in
future versions of Clang.

- ...

Modified Compiler Flags
-----------------------

- On ELF, ``-gz`` now defaults to ``-gz=zlib`` with the integrated assembler.
  It produces ``SHF_COMPRESSED`` style compression of debug information. GNU
  binutils 2.26 or newer, or lld is required to link produced object files. Use
  ``-gz=zlib-gnu`` to get the old behavior.
- Now that `this` pointers are tagged with `nonnull` and `dereferenceable(N)`,
  `-fno-delete-null-pointer-checks` has gained the power to remove the
  `nonnull` attribute on `this` for configurations that need it to be nullable.
- ``-gsplit-dwarf`` no longer implies ``-g2``.
- ``-fasynchronous-unwind-tables`` is now the default on Linux AArch64/PowerPC.
  This behavior matches newer GCC.
  (`D91760 <https://reviews.llvm.org/D91760>`_)
  (`D92054 <https://reviews.llvm.org/D92054>`_)

Removed Compiler Flags
-------------------------

The following options no longer exist.

- clang-cl's ``/Zd`` flag no longer exist. But ``-gline-tables-only`` still
  exists and does the same thing.

New Pragmas in Clang
--------------------

- ...

Attribute Changes in Clang
--------------------------

- Added support for the C++20 likelihood attributes ``[[likely]]`` and
  ``[[unlikely]]``. As an extension they can be used in C++11 and newer.
  This extension is enabled by default.

Windows Support
---------------

C Language Changes in Clang
---------------------------

- ...

C++ Language Changes in Clang
-----------------------------

- ...

C++1z Feature Support
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
...

Objective-C Language Changes in Clang
-------------------------------------

OpenCL C Language Changes in Clang
----------------------------------

...

ABI Changes in Clang
--------------------

OpenMP Support in Clang
-----------------------

- ...

CUDA Support in Clang
---------------------

- ...

X86 Support in Clang
--------------------

- The x86 intrinsics ``_mm_popcnt_u32``, ``_mm_popcnt_u64``, ``_popcnt32``,
  ``_popcnt64``, ``__popcntd`` and ``__popcntq``  may now be used within
  constant expressions.

- The x86 intrinsics ``_bit_scan_forward``, ``__bsfd`` and ``__bsfq`` may now
  be used within constant expressions.

- The x86 intrinsics ``_bit_scan_reverse``, ``__bsrd`` and ``__bsrq`` may now
  be used within constant expressions.

- The x86 intrinsics ``__bswap``, ``__bswapd``, ``__bswap64`` and ``__bswapq``
  may now be used within constant expressions.

- The x86 intrinsics ``_castf32_u32``, ``_castf64_u64``, ``_castu32_f32`` and
  ``_castu64_f64`` may now be used within constant expressions.

- The x86 intrinsics ``__rolb``, ``__rolw``, ``__rold``, ``__rolq`, ``_rotl``,
  ``_rotwl`` and ``_lrotl`` may now be used within constant expressions.

- The x86 intrinsics ``__rorb``, ``__rorw``, ``__rord``, ``__rorq`, ``_rotr``,
  ``_rotwr`` and ``_lrotr`` may now be used within constant expressions.

- Support for ``-march=alderlake``, ``-march=sapphirerapids`` and
  ``-march=znver3`` was added.

- Support for ``-march=x86-64-v[234]`` has been added.
  See :doc:`UsersManual` for details about these micro-architecture levels.

- The -mtune command line option is no longer ignored for X86. This can be used
  to request microarchitectural optimizations independent on -march. -march=<cpu>
  implies -mtune=<cpu>. -mtune=generic is the default with no -march or -mtune
  specified.

- Support for ``HRESET`` instructions has been added.

- Support for ``UINTR`` instructions has been added.

- Support for ``AVXVNNI`` instructions has been added.

Internal API Changes
--------------------

These are major API changes that have happened since the 11.0.0 release of
Clang. If upgrading an external codebase that uses Clang as a library,
this section should help get you past the largest hurdles of upgrading.

- ...

Build System Changes
--------------------

These are major changes to the build system that have happened since the 11.0.0
release of Clang. Users of the build system should adjust accordingly.

- ...

AST Matchers
------------

- The behavior of TK_IgnoreUnlessSpelledInSource with the traverse() matcher
  has been changed to no longer match on template instantiations or on
  implicit nodes which are not spelled in the source.

- The TK_IgnoreImplicitCastsAndParentheses traversal kind was removed. It
  is recommended to use TK_IgnoreUnlessSpelledInSource instead.

- The behavior of the forEach() matcher was changed to not internally ignore
  implicit and parenthesis nodes.

clang-format
------------

- Option ``BitFieldColonSpacing`` has been added that decides how
  space should be added around identifier, colon and bit-width in
  bitfield definitions.

  .. code-block:: c++

    // Both (default)
    struct F {
      unsigned dscp : 6;
      unsigned ecn  : 2; // AlignConsecutiveBitFields=true
    };
    // None
    struct F {
      unsigned dscp:6;
      unsigned ecn :2;
    };
    // Before
    struct F {
      unsigned dscp :6;
      unsigned ecn  :2;
    };
    // After
    struct F {
      unsigned dscp: 6;
      unsigned ecn : 2;
    };


- Experimental Support in clang-format for concepts has been improved, to
  aid this the follow options have been added

- Option ``IndentRequires`` has been added to indent the ``requires`` keyword
  in templates.
- Option ``BreakBeforeConceptDeclarations`` has been added to aid the formatting of concepts.

- Option ``IndentPragmas`` has been added to allow #pragma to indented with the current scope level. This is especially useful when using #pragma to mark OpenMP sections of code.

- Option ``SpaceBeforeCaseColon`` has been added to add a space before the
  colon in a case or default statement.

- Option ``StatementAttributeLikeMacros`` has been added to declare
  macros which are not parsed as a type in front of a statement. See
  the documentation for an example.
