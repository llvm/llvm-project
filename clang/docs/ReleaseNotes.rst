Introduction
============

This document contains the release notes for the Clang C/C++/Objective-C
frontend, part of the LLVM Compiler Infrastructure, release |release|. Here we
describe the status of Clang in some detail, including major
improvements from the previous release and new feature work. For the
general LLVM release notes, see `the LLVM
documentation <https://llvm.org/docs/ReleaseNotes.html>`_. All LLVM
releases may be downloaded from the `LLVM releases web
site <https://llvm.org/releases/>`_.

For more information about Clang or LLVM, including information about the
latest release, please see the `Clang Web Site <https://clang.llvm.org>`_ or the
`LLVM Web Site <https://llvm.org>`_.

Note that if you are reading this file from a Git checkout or the
main Clang web page, this document applies to the *next* release, not
the current one. To see the release notes for a specific release, please
see the `releases page <https://llvm.org/releases/>`_.

Potentially Breaking Changes
============================
These changes are ones which we think may surprise users when upgrading to
Clang |release| because of the opportunity they pose for disruption to existing
code bases.

- Clang will now correctly diagnose as ill-formed a constant expression where an
  enum without a fixed underlying type is set to a value outside the range of
  the enumeration's values.

  .. code-block:: c++

    enum E { Zero, One, Two, Three, Four };
    constexpr E Val1 = (E)3;  // Ok
    constexpr E Val2 = (E)7;  // Ok
    constexpr E Val3 = (E)8;  // Now diagnosed as out of the range [0, 7]
    constexpr E Val4 = (E)-1; // Now diagnosed as out of the range [0, 7]

  Due to the extended period of time this bug was present in major C++
  implementations (including Clang), this error has the ability to be
  downgraded into a warning (via: ``-Wno-error=enum-constexpr-conversion``) to
  provide a transition period for users. This diagnostic is expected to turn
  into an error-only diagnostic in the next Clang release. Fixes
  `Issue 50055 <https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues/50055>`_.

- ``-Wincompatible-function-pointer-types`` now defaults to an error in all C
  language modes. It may be downgraded to a warning with
  ``-Wno-error=incompatible-function-pointer-types`` or disabled entirely with
  ``-Wno-implicit-function-pointer-types``.

  **NOTE:** We recommend that projects using configure scripts verify that the
  results do not change before/after setting
  ``-Werror=incompatible-function-pointer-types`` to avoid incompatibility with
  Clang 16.

  .. code-block:: c

    void func(const int *i);
    void other(void) {
      void (*fp)(int *) = func; // Previously a warning, now a downgradable error.
    }

- Clang now disallows types whose sizes aren't a multiple of their alignments
  to be used as the element type of arrays.

  .. code-block:: c

  typedef char int8_a16 __attribute__((aligned(16)));
  int8_a16 array[4]; // Now diagnosed as the element size not being a multiple of the array alignment.


What's New in Clang |release|?
==============================
Some of the major new features and improvements to Clang are listed
here. Generic improvements to Clang as a whole or to its underlying
infrastructure are described first, followed by language-specific
sections with improvements to Clang's support for those languages.

Major New Features
------------------

Bug Fixes
---------
- Correct ``_Static_assert`` to accept the same set of extended integer
  constant expressions as is accpted in other contexts that accept them.
  This fixes `Issue 57687 <https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues/57687>`_.
- Fixes an accepts-invalid bug in C when using a ``_Noreturn`` function
  specifier on something other than a function declaration. This fixes
  `Issue 56800 <https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues/56800>`_.
- Fix `#56772 <https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues/56772>`_ - invalid
  destructor names were incorrectly accepted on template classes.
- Improve compile-times with large dynamic array allocations with trivial
  constructors. This fixes
  `Issue 56774 <https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues/56774>`_.
- No longer assert/miscompile when trying to make a vectorized ``_BitInt`` type
  using the ``ext_vector_type`` attribute (the ``vector_size`` attribute was
  already properly diagnosing this case).
- Fix clang not properly diagnosing the failing subexpression when chained
  binary operators are used in a ``static_assert`` expression.
- Fix a crash when evaluating a multi-dimensional array's array filler
  expression is element-dependent. This fixes
  `Issue 50601 <https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues/56016>`_.
- Fixed a crash-on-valid with consteval evaluation of a list-initialized
  constructor for a temporary object. This fixes
  `Issue 55871 <https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues/55871>`_.
- Fix `#57008 <https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues/57008>`_ - Builtin
  C++ language extension type traits instantiated by a template with unexpected
  number of arguments cause an assertion fault.
- Fix multi-level pack expansion of undeclared function parameters.
  This fixes `Issue 56094 <https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues/56094>`_.
- Fix `#57151 <https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues/57151>`_.
  ``-Wcomma`` is emitted for void returning functions.
- ``-Wtautological-compare`` missed warnings for tautological comparisons
  involving a negative integer literal. This fixes
  `Issue 42918 <https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues/42918>`_.
- Fix a crash when generating code coverage information for an
  ``if consteval`` statement. This fixes
  `Issue 57377 <https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues/57377>`_.
- Fix assert that triggers a crash during template name lookup when a type was
  incomplete but was not also a TagType. This fixes
  `Issue 57387 <https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues/57387>`_.
- Fix a crash when emitting a concept-related diagnostic. This fixes
  `Issue 57415 <https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues/57415>`_.
- Fix a crash when attempting to default a virtual constexpr non-special member
  function in a derived class. This fixes
  `Issue 57431 <https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues/57431>`_
- Fix a crash where we attempt to define a deleted destructor. This fixes
  `Issue 57516 <https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues/57516>`_
- Fix ``__builtin_assume_aligned`` crash when the 1st arg is array type. This fixes
  `Issue 57169 <https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues/57169>`_
- Clang configuration files are now read through the virtual file system
  rather than the physical one, if these are different.
- Clang will now no longer treat a C 'overloadable' function without a prototype as
  a variadic function with the attribute.  This should make further diagnostics more
  clear.
- Fixes to builtin template emulation of regular templates.
  `Issue 42102 <https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues/42102>`_
  `Issue 51928 <https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues/51928>`_
- A SubstTemplateTypeParmType can now represent the pack index for a
  substitution from an expanded pack.
  `Issue 56099 <https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues/56099>`_
- Fix `-Wpre-c++17-compat` crashing Clang when compiling C++20 code which
  contains deduced template specializations. This Fixes
  `Issue 57369 <https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues/57369>`_
  `Issue 57643 <https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues/57643>`_
  `Issue 57793 <https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues/57793>`_
- Respect constructor constraints during class template argument deduction (CTAD).
  This is the suggested resolution to CWG DR2628.
  `Issue 57646 <https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues/57646>`_
  `Issue 43829 <https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues/43829>`_
- Fixed a crash in C++20 mode in Clang and Clangd when compile source
  with compilation errors.
  `Issue 53628 <https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues/53628>`_
- The template arguments of a variable template being accessed as a
  member will now be represented in the AST.
- Fix incorrect handling of inline builtins with asm labels.


Improvements to Clang's diagnostics
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- Clang will now check compile-time determinable string literals as format strings.
  Fixes `Issue 55805: <https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues/55805>`_.
- ``-Wformat`` now recognizes ``%b`` for the ``printf``/``scanf`` family of
  functions and ``%B`` for the ``printf`` family of functions. Fixes
  `Issue 56885: <https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues/56885>`_.
- Introduced ``-Wsingle-bit-bitfield-constant-conversion``, grouped under
  ``-Wbitfield-constant-conversion``, which diagnoses implicit truncation when
  ``1`` is assigned to a 1-bit signed integer bitfield. This fixes
  `Issue 53253 <https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues/53253>`_. To reduce
  potential false positives, this diagnostic will not diagnose use of the
  ``true`` macro (from ``<stdbool.h>>`) in C language mode despite the macro
  being defined to expand to ``1``.
- Clang will now print more information about failed static assertions. In
  particular, simple static assertion expressions are evaluated to their
  compile-time value and printed out if the assertion fails.
- Diagnostics about uninitialized ``constexpr`` varaibles have been improved
  to mention the missing constant initializer.
- Correctly diagnose a future keyword if it exist as a keyword in the higher
  language version and specifies in which version it will be a keyword. This
  supports both c and c++ language.
- When diagnosing multi-level pack expansions of mismatched lengths, Clang will
  now, in most cases, be able to point to the relevant outer parameter.
- ``no_sanitize("...")`` on a global variable for known but not relevant
  sanitizers is now just a warning. It now says that this will be ignored
  instead of incorrectly saying no_sanitize only applies to functions and
  methods.
- No longer mention ``reinterpet_cast`` in the invalid constant expression
  diagnostic note when in C mode.
- Clang will now give a more suitale diagnostic for declaration of block
  scope identifiers that have external/internal linkage that has an initializer.
  Fixes `Issue 57478: <https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues/57478>`_.
- New analysis pass will now help preserve sugar when combining deductions, in an
  order agnostic way. This will be in effect when deducing template arguments,
  when deducing function return type from multiple return statements, for the
  conditional operator, and for most binary operations. Type sugar is combined
  in a way that strips the sugar which is different between terms, and preserves
  those which are common.
- Correctly diagnose use of an integer literal without a suffix whose
  underlying type is ``long long`` or ``unsigned long long`` as an extension in
  C89 mode . Clang previously only diagnosed if the literal had an explicit
  ``LL`` suffix.
- Clang now correctly diagnoses index that refers past the last possible element
  of FAM-like arrays.
- Clang now correctly diagnoses a warning when defercencing a void pointer in C mode.
  This fixes `Issue 53631 <https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues/53631>`_
- Clang will now diagnose an overload set where a candidate has a constraint that
  refers to an expression with a previous error as nothing viable, so that it
  doesn't generate strange cascading errors, particularly in cases where a
  subsuming constraint fails, which would result in a less-specific overload to
  be selected.

Non-comprehensive list of changes in this release
-------------------------------------------------
- It's now possible to set the crash diagnostics directory through
  the environment variable ``CLANG_CRASH_DIAGNOSTICS_DIR``.
  The ``-fcrash-diagnostics-dir`` flag takes precedence.
- When using header modules, inclusion of a private header and violations of
  the `use-declaration rules
  <https://clang.llvm.org/docs/Modules.html#use-declaration>`_ are now
  diagnosed even when the includer is a textual header. This change can be
  temporarily reversed with ``-Xclang
  -fno-modules-validate-textual-header-includes``, but this flag will be
  removed in a future Clang release.
- Unicode support has been updated to support Unicode 15.0.
  New unicode codepoints are supported as appropriate in diagnostics,
  C and C++ identifiers, and escape sequences.

New Compiler Flags
------------------

- Implemented `-fcoro-aligned-allocation` flag. This flag implements
  Option 2 of P2014R0 aligned allocation of coroutine frames
  (`P2014R0 <https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2020/p2014r0.pdf>`_).
  With this flag, the coroutines will try to lookup aligned allocation
  function all the time. The compiler will emit an error if it fails to
  find aligned allocation function. So if the user code implemented self
  defined allocation function for coroutines, the existing code will be
  broken. A little divergence with P2014R0 is that clang will lookup
  `::operator new(size_­t, std::aligned_val_t, nothrow_­t)` if there is
  `get_­return_­object_­on_­allocation_­failure`. We feel this is more consistent
  with the intention.

New Pragmas in Clang
--------------------
- ...

Attribute Changes in Clang
--------------------------
- Added support for ``__attribute__((guard(nocf)))`` and C++-style
  ``[[clang::guard(nocf)]]``, which is equivalent to ``__declspec(guard(nocf))``
  when using the MSVC environment. This is to support enabling Windows Control
  Flow Guard checks with the ability to disable them for specific functions when
  using the MinGW environment. This attribute is only available for Windows
  targets.

- Introduced a new function attribute ``__attribute__((nouwtable))`` to suppress
  LLVM IR ``uwtable`` function attribute.

- Updated the value returned by ``__has_c_attribute(nodiscard)`` to ``202003L``
  based on the final date specified by the C2x committee draft. We already
  supported the ability to specify a message in the attribute, so there were no
  changes to the attribute behavior.

- Updated the value returned by ``__has_c_attribute(fallthrough)`` to ``201910L``
  based on the final date specified by the C2x committee draft. We previously
  used ``201904L`` (the date the proposal was seen by the committee) by mistake.
  There were no other changes to the attribute behavior.

Windows Support
---------------
- For the MinGW driver, added the options ``-mguard=none``, ``-mguard=cf`` and
  ``-mguard=cf-nochecks`` (equivalent to ``/guard:cf-``, ``/guard:cf`` and
  ``/guard:cf,nochecks`` in clang-cl) for enabling Control Flow Guard checks
  and generation of address-taken function table.

AIX Support
-----------
* When using ``-shared``, the clang driver now invokes llvm-nm to create an
  export list if the user doesn't specify one via linker flag or pass an
  alternative export control option.

C Language Changes in Clang
---------------------------
- Adjusted ``-Wformat`` warnings according to `WG14 N2562 <https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n2562.pdf>`_.
  Clang will now consider default argument promotions in ``printf``, and remove
  unnecessary warnings. Especially ``int`` argument with specifier ``%hhd`` and
  ``%hd``.

C2x Feature Support
-------------------
- Implemented `WG14 N2662 <https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n2662.pdf>`_,
  so the [[maybe_unused]] attribute may be applied to a label to silence an
  ``-Wunused-label`` warning.
- Implemented `WG14 N2508 <https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n2508.pdf>`_,
  so labels can placed everywhere inside a compound statement.
- Implemented `WG14 N2927 <https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n2927.htm>`_,
  the Not-so-magic ``typeof`` operator. Also implemented
  `WG14 N2930 <https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n2930.pdf>`_,
  renaming ``remove_quals``, so the ``typeof_unqual`` operator is also
  supported. Both of these operators are supported only in C2x mode. The
  ``typeof`` operator specifies the type of the given parenthesized expression
  operand or type name, including all qualifiers. The ``typeof_unqual``
  operator is similar to ``typeof`` except that all qualifiers are removed,
  including atomic type qualification and type attributes which behave like a
  qualifier, such as an address space attribute.

  .. code-block:: c

    __attribute__((address_space(1))) const _Atomic int Val;
    typeof(Val) OtherVal; // type is '__attribute__((address_space(1))) const _Atomic int'
    typeof_unqual(Val) OtherValUnqual; // type is 'int'

C++ Language Changes in Clang
-----------------------------
- Implemented DR692, DR1395 and DR1432. Use the ``-fclang-abi-compat=15`` option
  to get the old partial ordering behavior regarding packs.
- Clang's default C++/ObjC++ standard is now ``gnu++17`` instead of ``gnu++14``.
  This means Clang will by default accept code using features from C++17 and
  conforming GNU extensions. Projects incompatible with C++17 can add
  ``-std=gnu++14`` to their build settings to restore the previous behaviour.

C++20 Feature Support
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- Support capturing structured bindings in lambdas
  (`P1091R3 <https://wg21.link/p1091r3>`_ and `P1381R1 <https://wg21.link/P1381R1>`).
  This fixes issues `Issue 52720 <https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues/52720>`_,
  `Issue 54300 <https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues/54300>`_,
  `Issue 54301 <https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues/54301>`_,
  and `Issue 49430 <https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues/49430>`_.
- Consider explicitly defaulted constexpr/consteval special member function
  template instantiation to be constexpr/consteval even though a call to such
  a function cannot appear in a constant expression.
  (C++14 [dcl.constexpr]p6 (CWG DR647/CWG DR1358))
- Correctly defer dependent immediate function invocations until template instantiation.
  This fixes `Issue 55601 <https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues/55601>`_.
- Implemented "Conditionally Trivial Special Member Functions" (`P0848 <https://wg21.link/p0848r3>`_).
  Note: The handling of deleted functions is not yet compliant, as Clang
  does not implement `DR1496 <https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/cwg_defects.html#1496>`_
  and `DR1734 <https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/cwg_defects.html#1734>`_.
- Class member variables are now in scope when parsing a ``requires`` clause. Fixes
  `Issue 55216 <https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues/55216>`_.
- Correctly set expression evaluation context as 'immediate function context' in
  consteval functions.
  This fixes `Issue 51182 <https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues/51182>`_.
- Fixes an assert crash caused by looking up missing vtable information on ``consteval``
  virtual functions. Fixes `Issue 55065 <https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues/55065>`_.
- Skip rebuilding lambda expressions in arguments of immediate invocations.
  This fixes `Issue 56183 <https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues/56183>`_,
  `Issue 51695 <https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues/51695>`_,
  `Issue 50455 <https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues/50455>`_,
  `Issue 54872 <https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues/54872>`_,
  `Issue 54587 <https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues/54587>`_.
- Clang now correctly delays the instantiation of function constraints until
  the time of checking, which should now allow the libstdc++ ranges implementation
  to work for at least trivial examples.  This fixes
  `Issue 44178 <https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues/44178>`_.
- Clang implements DR2621, correcting a defect in ``using enum`` handling.  The
  name is found via ordinary lookup so typedefs are found.
- Implemented `P0634r3 <https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2018/p0634r3.html>`_,
  which removes the requirement for the ``typename`` keyword in certain contexts.

C++2b Feature Support
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Support label at end of compound statement (`P2324 <https://wg21.link/p2324r2>`_).

libclang
--------
- Introduced the new function ``clang_getUnqualifiedType``, which mimics
  the behavior of ``QualType::getUnqualifiedType`` for ``CXType``.
- Introduced the new function ``clang_getNonReferenceType``, which mimics
  the behavior of ``QualType::getNonReferenceType`` for ``CXType``.
- Introduced the new function ``clang_CXXMethod_isDeleted``, which queries
  whether the method is declared ``= delete``.
- ``clang_Cursor_getNumTemplateArguments``, ``clang_Cursor_getTemplateArgumentKind``, 
  ``clang_Cursor_getTemplateArgumentType``, ``clang_Cursor_getTemplateArgumentValue`` and 
  ``clang_Cursor_getTemplateArgumentUnsignedValue`` now work on struct, class,
  and partial template specialization cursors in addition to function cursors.

Static Analyzer
---------------
- Removed the deprecated ``-analyzer-store`` and
  ``-analyzer-opt-analyze-nested-blocks`` analyzer flags.
  ``scanbuild`` was also updated accordingly.
  Passing these flags will result in a hard error.

.. _release-notes-sanitizers:

Sanitizers
----------
- ``-fsanitize-memory-param-retval`` is turned on by default. With
  ``-fsanitize=memory``, passing uninitialized variables to functions and
  returning uninitialized variables from functions is more aggressively
  reported. ``-fno-sanitize-memory-param-retval`` restores the previous
  behavior.
