Introduction
============

This document contains the release notes for the Clang C/C++/Objective-C
frontend, part of the LLVM Compiler Infrastructure, release |release|. Here we
describe the status of Clang in some detail, including major
improvements from the previous release and new feature work. For the
general LLVM release notes, see `the LLVM
documentation <https://llvm.org/docs/ReleaseNotes.html>`_. For the libc++ release notes,
see `this page <https://libcxx.llvm.org/ReleaseNotes.html>`_. All LLVM releases
may be downloaded from the `LLVM releases web site <https://llvm.org/releases/>`_.

latest release, please see the `Clang Web Site <https://clang.llvm.org>`_ or the
`LLVM Web Site <https://llvm.org>`_.

Potentially Breaking Changes
============================
These changes are ones which we think may surprise users when upgrading to
Clang |release| because of the opportunity they pose for disruption to existing
code bases.

- The ``le32`` and ``le64`` targets have been removed.

- ``clang -m32`` defaults to ``-mcpu=v9`` on SPARC Linux now.  Distros
  still supporting SPARC V8 CPUs need to specify ``-mcpu=v8`` with a
  `config file
  <https://clang.llvm.org/docs/UsersManual.html#configuration-files>`_.

- The ``clang-rename`` tool has been removed.

C/C++ Language Potentially Breaking Changes
-------------------------------------------

C++ Specific Potentially Breaking Changes
-----------------------------------------

- The type trait builtin ``__is_nullptr`` has been removed, since it has very
  few users and can be written as ``__is_same(__remove_cv(T), decltype(nullptr))``,
  which GCC supports as well.

- Clang will now correctly diagnose as ill-formed a constant expression where an
  enum without a fixed underlying type is set to a value outside the range of
  the enumeration's values.

  .. code-block:: c++

    enum E { Zero, One, Two, Three, Four };
    constexpr E Val1 = (E)3;  // Ok
    constexpr E Val2 = (E)7;  // Ok
    constexpr E Val3 = (E)8;  // Now ill-formed, out of the range [0, 7]
    constexpr E Val4 = (E)-1; // Now ill-formed, out of the range [0, 7]

  Since Clang 16, it has been possible to suppress the diagnostic via
  `-Wno-enum-constexpr-conversion`, to allow for a transition period for users.
  Now, in Clang 20, **it is no longer possible to suppress the diagnostic**.

- Extraneous template headers are now ill-formed by default.
  This error can be disable with ``-Wno-error=extraneous-template-head``.

  .. code-block:: c++

    template <> // error: extraneous template head
    template <typename T>
    void f();

- During constant evaluation, comparisons between different evaluations of the
  same string literal are now correctly treated as non-constant, and comparisons
  between string literals that cannot possibly overlap in memory are now treated
  as constant. This updates Clang to match the anticipated direction of open core
  issue `CWG2765 <http://wg21.link/CWG2765>`, but is subject to change once that
  issue is resolved.

  .. code-block:: c++

    constexpr const char *f() { return "hello"; }
    constexpr const char *g() { return "world"; }
    // Used to evaluate to false, now error: non-constant comparison.
    constexpr bool a = f() == f();
    // Might evaluate to true or false, as before.
    bool at_runtime() { return f() == f(); }
    // Was error, now evaluates to false.
    constexpr bool b = f() == g();

ABI Changes in This Version
---------------------------

- Fixed Microsoft name mangling of placeholder, auto and decltype(auto), return types for MSVC 1920+. This change resolves incompatibilities with code compiled by MSVC 1920+ but will introduce incompatibilities with code compiled by earlier versions of Clang unless such code is built with the compiler option -fms-compatibility-version=19.14 to imitate the MSVC 1914 mangling behavior.

AST Dumping Potentially Breaking Changes
----------------------------------------

Clang Frontend Potentially Breaking Changes
-------------------------------------------

Clang Python Bindings Potentially Breaking Changes
--------------------------------------------------
- Parts of the interface returning string results will now return
  the empty string ``""`` when no result is available, instead of ``None``.
- Calling a property on the ``CompletionChunk`` or ``CompletionString`` class
  statically now leads to an error, instead of returning a ``CachedProperty`` object
  that is used internally. Properties are only available on instances.
- For a single-line ``SourceRange`` and a ``SourceLocation`` in the same line,
  but after the end of the ``SourceRange``, ``SourceRange.__contains__``
  used to incorrectly return ``True``. (#GH22617), (#GH52827)

What's New in Clang |release|?
==============================
Some of the major new features and improvements to Clang are listed
here. Generic improvements to Clang as a whole or to its underlying
infrastructure are described first, followed by language-specific
sections with improvements to Clang's support for those languages.

C++ Language Changes
--------------------
- Allow single element access of GCC vector/ext_vector_type object to be
  constant expression. Supports the `V.xyzw` syntax and other tidbits
  as seen in OpenCL. Selecting multiple elements is left as a future work.
- Implement `CWG1815 <https://wg21.link/CWG1815>`_. Support lifetime extension
  of temporary created by aggregate initialization using a default member
  initializer.

- Accept C++26 user-defined ``static_assert`` messages in C++11 as an extension.

- Add ``__builtin_elementwise_popcount`` builtin for integer types only.

- Add ``__builtin_elementwise_fmod`` builtin for floating point types only.

- The builtin type alias ``__builtin_common_type`` has been added to improve the
  performance of ``std::common_type``.

C++2c Feature Support
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Add ``__builtin_is_implicit_lifetime`` intrinsic, which supports
  `P2647R1 A trait for implicit lifetime types <https://wg21.link/p2674r1>`_

- Add ``__builtin_is_virtual_base_of`` intrinsic, which supports
  `P2985R0 A type trait for detecting virtual base classes <https://wg21.link/p2985r0>`_

- Implemented `P2893R3 Variadic Friends <https://wg21.link/P2893>`_

- Implemented `P2747R2 constexpr placement new <https://wg21.link/P2747R2>`_.

- Added the ``__builtin_is_within_lifetime`` builtin, which supports
  `P2641R4 Checking if a union alternative is active <https://wg21.link/p2641r4>`_

C++23 Feature Support
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- Removed the restriction to literal types in constexpr functions in C++23 mode.

C++20 Feature Support
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


Resolutions to C++ Defect Reports
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Allow calling initializer list constructors from initializer lists with
  a single element of the same type instead of always copying.
  (`CWG2137: List-initialization from object of same type <https://cplusplus.github.io/CWG/issues/2137.html>`)

- Speculative resolution for CWG2311 implemented so that the implementation of CWG2137 doesn't remove
  previous cases where guaranteed copy elision was done. Given a prvalue ``e`` of class type
  ``T``, ``T{e}`` will try to resolve an initializer list constructor and will use it if successful.
  Otherwise, if there is no initializer list constructor, the copy will be elided as if it was ``T(e)``.
  (`CWG2311: Missed case for guaranteed copy elision <https://cplusplus.github.io/CWG/issues/2311.html>`)

- Casts from a bit-field to an integral type is now not considered narrowing if the
  width of the bit-field means that all potential values are in the range
  of the target type, even if the type of the bit-field is larger.
  (`CWG2627: Bit-fields and narrowing conversions <https://cplusplus.github.io/CWG/issues/2627.html>`_)

- ``nullptr`` is now promoted to ``void*`` when passed to a C-style variadic function.
  (`CWG722: Can nullptr be passed to an ellipsis? <https://cplusplus.github.io/CWG/issues/722.html>`_)

- Allow ``void{}`` as a prvalue of type ``void``.
  (`CWG2351: void{} <https://cplusplus.github.io/CWG/issues/2351.html>`_).

- Clang now has improved resolution to CWG2398, allowing class templates to have
  default arguments deduced when partial ordering.

- Clang now allows comparing unequal object pointers that have been cast to ``void *``
  in constant expressions. These comparisons always worked in non-constant expressions.
  (`CWG2749: Treatment of "pointer to void" for relational comparisons <https://cplusplus.github.io/CWG/issues/2749.html>`_).

- Reject explicit object parameters with type ``void`` (``this void``).
  (`CWG2915: Explicit object parameters of type void <https://cplusplus.github.io/CWG/issues/2915.html>`_).

C Language Changes
------------------

C2y Feature Support
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

C23 Feature Support
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Clang now supports `N3029 <https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n3029.htm>`_ Improved Normal Enumerations.

Non-comprehensive list of changes in this release
-------------------------------------------------

- The floating point comparison builtins (``__builtin_isgreater``,
  ``__builtin_isgreaterequal``, ``__builtin_isless``, etc.) and
  ``__builtin_signbit`` can now be used in constant expressions.

New Compiler Flags
------------------

- The ``-fc++-static-destructors={all,thread-local,none}`` flag was
  added to control which C++ variables have static destructors
  registered: all (the default) does so for all variables, thread-local
  only for thread-local variables, and none (which corresponds to the
  existing ``-fno-c++-static-destructors`` flag) skips all static
  destructors registration.

Deprecated Compiler Flags
-------------------------

- ``-fheinous-gnu-extensions`` is deprecated; it is now equivalent to
  specifying ``-Wno-error=invalid-gnu-asm-cast`` and may be removed in the
  future.

Modified Compiler Flags
-----------------------

- The ``-ffp-model`` option has been updated to enable a more limited set of
  optimizations when the ``fast`` argument is used and to accept a new argument,
  ``aggressive``. The behavior of ``-ffp-model=aggressive`` is equivalent
  to the previous behavior of ``-ffp-model=fast``. The updated
  ``-ffp-model=fast`` behavior no longer assumes finite math only and uses
  the ``promoted`` algorithm for complex division when possible rather than the
  less basic (limited range) algorithm.

Removed Compiler Flags
-------------------------

- The compiler flag `-Wenum-constexpr-conversion` (and the `Wno-`, `Wno-error-`
  derivatives) is now removed, since it's no longer possible to suppress the
  diagnostic (see above). Users can expect an `unknown warning` diagnostic if
  it's still in use.

Attribute Changes in Clang
--------------------------

- Clang now disallows more than one ``__attribute__((ownership_returns(class, idx)))`` with
  different class names attached to one function.

- Introduced a new format attribute ``__attribute__((format(syslog, 1, 2)))`` from OpenBSD.

- The ``hybrid_patchable`` attribute is now supported on ARM64EC targets. It can be used to specify
  that a function requires an additional x86-64 thunk, which may be patched at runtime.

- ``[[clang::lifetimebound]]`` is now explicitly disallowed on explicit object member functions
  where they were previously silently ignored.

- Clang now automatically adds ``[[clang::lifetimebound]]`` to the parameters of
  ``std::span, std::string_view`` constructors, this enables Clang to capture
  more cases where the returned reference outlives the object.
  (#GH100567)

- Clang now correctly diagnoses the use of ``btf_type_tag`` in C++ and ignores
  it; this attribute is a C-only attribute, and caused crashes with template
  instantiation by accidentally allowing it in C++ in some circumstances.
  (#GH106864)

- Introduced a new attribute ``[[clang::coro_await_elidable]]`` on coroutine return types
  to express elideability at call sites where the coroutine is invoked under a safe elide context.

- Introduced a new attribute ``[[clang::coro_await_elidable_argument]]`` on function parameters
  to propagate safe elide context to arguments if such function is also under a safe elide context.

- The documentation of the ``[[clang::musttail]]`` attribute was updated to
  note that the lifetimes of all local variables end before the call. This does
  not change the behaviour of the compiler, as this was true for previous
  versions.

- Fix a bug where clang doesn't automatically apply the ``[[gsl::Owner]]`` or
  ``[[gsl::Pointer]]`` to STL explicit template specialization decls. (#GH109442)

Improvements to Clang's diagnostics
-----------------------------------

- Some template related diagnostics have been improved.

  .. code-block:: c++

     void foo() { template <typename> int i; } // error: templates can only be declared in namespace or class scope

     struct S {
      template <typename> int i; // error: non-static data member 'i' cannot be declared as a template
     };

- Clang now has improved diagnostics for functions with explicit 'this' parameters. Fixes #GH97878

- Clang now diagnoses dangling references to fields of temporary objects. Fixes #GH81589.

- Clang now diagnoses undefined behavior in constant expressions more consistently. This includes invalid shifts, and signed overflow in arithmetic.

- -Wdangling-assignment-gsl is enabled by default.
- Clang now always preserves the template arguments as written used
  to specialize template type aliases.

- Clang now diagnoses the use of ``main`` in an ``extern`` context as invalid according to [basic.start.main] p3. Fixes #GH101512.

- Clang now diagnoses when the result of a [[nodiscard]] function is discarded after being cast in C. Fixes #GH104391.

- Don't emit duplicated dangling diagnostics. (#GH93386).

- Improved diagnostic when trying to befriend a concept. (#GH45182).

- Added the ``-Winvalid-gnu-asm-cast`` diagnostic group to control warnings
  about use of "noop" casts for lvalues (a GNU extension). This diagnostic is
  a warning which defaults to being an error, is enabled by default, and is
  also controlled by the now-deprecated ``-fheinous-gnu-extensions`` flag.

- Added the ``-Wdecls-in-multiple-modules`` option to assist users to identify
  multiple declarations in different modules, which is the major reason of the slow
  compilation speed with modules. This warning is disabled by default and it needs
  to be explicitly enabled or by ``-Weverything``.

- Improved diagnostic when trying to overload a function in an ``extern "C"`` context. (#GH80235)

- Clang now respects lifetimebound attribute for the assignment operator parameter. (#GH106372).

- The lifetimebound and GSL analysis in clang are coherent, allowing clang to
  detect more use-after-free bugs. (#GH100549).

- Clang now diagnoses dangling cases where a gsl-pointer is constructed from a gsl-owner object inside a container (#GH100384).

- Clang now warns for u8 character literals used in C23 with ``-Wpre-c23-compat`` instead of ``-Wpre-c++17-compat``.

- Clang now diagnose when importing module implementation partition units in module interface units.

- Don't emit bogus dangling diagnostics when ``[[gsl::Owner]]`` and `[[clang::lifetimebound]]` are used together (#GH108272).

- The ``-Wreturn-stack-address`` warning now also warns about addresses of
  local variables passed to function calls using the ``[[clang::musttail]]``
  attribute.

- Clang now diagnoses cases where a dangling ``GSLOwner<GSLPointer>`` object is constructed, e.g. ``std::vector<string_view> v = {std::string()};`` (#GH100526).

Improvements to Clang's time-trace
----------------------------------

Improvements to Coverage Mapping
--------------------------------

OpenACC Specific Changes
------------------------

Target Specific Changes
-----------------------

AMDGPU Support
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

X86 Support
^^^^^^^^^^^

- The MMX vector intrinsic functions from ``*mmintrin.h`` which
  operate on `__m64` vectors, such as ``_mm_add_pi8``, have been
  reimplemented to use the SSE2 instruction-set and XMM registers
  unconditionally. These intrinsics are therefore *no longer
  supported* if MMX is enabled without SSE2 -- either from targeting
  CPUs from the Pentium-MMX through the Pentium 3, or explicitly via
  passing arguments such as ``-mmmx -mno-sse2``. MMX assembly code
  remains supported without requiring SSE2, including inside
  inline-assembly.

- The compiler builtins such as ``__builtin_ia32_paddb`` which
  formerly implemented the above MMX intrinsic functions have been
  removed. Any uses of these removed functions should migrate to the
  functions defined by the ``*mmintrin.h`` headers. A mapping can be
  found in the file ``clang/www/builtins.py``.

- Support ISA of ``AVX10.2``.
  * Supported MINMAX intrinsics of ``*_(mask(z)))_minmax(ne)_p[s|d|h|bh]`` and
  ``*_(mask(z)))_minmax_s[s|d|h]``.

Arm and AArch64 Support
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Android Support
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Windows Support
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Clang no longer allows references inside a union when emulating MSVC 1900+ even if `fms-extensions` is enabled.
  Starting with VS2015, MSVC 1900, this Microsoft extension is no longer allowed and always results in an error.
  Clang now follows the MSVC behavior in this scenario.
  When `-fms-compatibility-version=18.00` or prior is set on the command line this Microsoft extension is still
  allowed as VS2013 and prior allow it.

LoongArch Support
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

RISC-V Support
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- The option ``-mcmodel=large`` for the large code model is supported.

CUDA/HIP Language Changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

CUDA Support
^^^^^^^^^^^^

AIX Support
^^^^^^^^^^^

NetBSD Support
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

WebAssembly Support
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

AVR Support
^^^^^^^^^^^

DWARF Support in Clang
----------------------

Floating Point Support in Clang
-------------------------------

Fixed Point Support in Clang
----------------------------

AST Matchers
------------

- Fixed an issue with the `hasName` and `hasAnyName` matcher when matching
  inline namespaces with an enclosing namespace of the same name.

- Fixed an ordering issue with the `hasOperands` matcher occurring when setting a
  binding in the first matcher and using it in the second matcher.

- Fixed a crash when traverse lambda expr with invalid captures. (#GH106444)

clang-format
------------

- Adds ``BreakBinaryOperations`` option.

libclang
--------
- Add ``clang_isBeforeInTranslationUnit``. Given two source locations, it determines
  whether the first one comes strictly before the second in the source code.

Static Analyzer
---------------

New features
^^^^^^^^^^^^

- MallocChecker now checks for ``ownership_returns(class, idx)`` and ``ownership_takes(class, idx)``
  attributes with class names different from "malloc". Clang static analyzer now reports an error
  if class of allocation and deallocation function mismatches.
  `Documentation <https://clang.llvm.org/docs/analyzer/checkers.html#unix-mismatcheddeallocator-c-c>`__.

Crash and bug fixes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Improvements
^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Improved the handling of the ``ownership_returns`` attribute. Now, Clang reports an
  error if the attribute is attached to a function that returns a non-pointer value.
  Fixes (#GH99501)

Moved checkers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- The checker ``alpha.security.MallocOverflow`` was deleted because it was
  badly implemented and its agressive logic produced too many false positives.
  To detect too large arguments passed to malloc, consider using the checker
  ``alpha.taint.TaintedAlloc``.

.. _release-notes-sanitizers:

Sanitizers
----------
- Introduced Realtime Sanitizer, activated by using the -fsanitize=realtime
  flag. This sanitizer detects unsafe system library calls, such as memory
  allocations and mutex locks. If any such function is called during invocation
  of a function marked with the ``[[clang::nonblocking]]`` attribute, an error
  is printed to the console and the process exits non-zero.

- Added the ``-fsanitize-undefined-ignore-overflow-pattern`` flag which can be
  used to disable specific overflow-dependent code patterns. The supported
  patterns are: ``add-signed-overflow-test``, ``add-unsigned-overflow-test``,
  ``negated-unsigned-const``, and ``unsigned-post-decr-while``. The sanitizer
  instrumentation can be toggled off for all available patterns by specifying
  ``all``. Conversely, you may disable all exclusions with ``none`` which is
  the default.

  .. code-block:: c++

     /// specified with ``-fsanitize-undefined-ignore-overflow-pattern=add-unsigned-overflow-test``
     int common_overflow_check_pattern(unsigned base, unsigned offset) {
       if (base + offset < base) { /* ... */ } // The pattern of `a + b < a`, and other re-orderings, won't be instrumented
     }

     /// specified with ``-fsanitize-undefined-ignore-overflow-pattern=add-signed-overflow-test``
     int common_overflow_check_pattern_signed(signed int base, signed int offset) {
       if (base + offset < base) { /* ... */ } // The pattern of `a + b < a`, and other re-orderings, won't be instrumented
     }

     /// specified with ``-fsanitize-undefined-ignore-overflow-pattern=negated-unsigned-const``
     void negation_overflow() {
       unsigned long foo = -1UL; // No longer causes a negation overflow warning
       unsigned long bar = -2UL; // and so on...
     }

     /// specified with ``-fsanitize-undefined-ignore-overflow-pattern=unsigned-post-decr-while``
     void while_post_decrement() {
       unsigned char count = 16;
       while (count--) { /* ... */ } // No longer causes unsigned-integer-overflow sanitizer to trip
     }

  Many existing projects have a large amount of these code patterns present.
  This new flag should allow those projects to enable integer sanitizers with
  less noise.

Python Binding Changes
----------------------
- Fixed an issue that led to crashes when calling ``Type.get_exception_specification_kind``.

OpenMP Support
--------------
- Added support for 'omp assume' directive.
- Added support for 'omp scope' directive.

Improvements
^^^^^^^^^^^^
- Improve the handling of mapping array-section for struct containing nested structs with user defined mappers

- `num_teams` and `thead_limit` now accept multiple expressions when it is used
  along in ``target teams ompx_bare`` construct. This allows the target region
  to be launched with multi-dim grid on GPUs.
