     These are in-progress notes for the upcoming Clang |version| release.
     Release notes for previous releases can be found on
     `the Releases Page <https://llvm.org/releases/>`_.

Introduction
============

This document contains the release notes for the Clang C/C++/Objective-C
frontend, part of the LLVM Compiler Infrastructure, release |release|. Here we
describe the status of Clang in some detail, including major
improvements from the previous release and new feature work. For the
general LLVM release notes, see `the LLVM
documentation <https://llvm.org/docs/ReleaseNotes.html>`_. For the libc++ release notes,
see `this page <https://libcxx.llvm.org/ReleaseNotes.html>`_. All LLVM releases
may be downloaded from the `LLVM releases web site <https://llvm.org/releases/>`_.

For more information about Clang or LLVM, including information about the
latest release, please see the `Clang Web Site <https://clang.llvm.org>`_ or the
`LLVM Web Site <https://llvm.org>`_.

Potentially Breaking Changes
============================

C/C++ Language Potentially Breaking Changes
-------------------------------------------

- The ``__has_builtin`` function now only considers the currently active target when being used with target offloading.

C++ Specific Potentially Breaking Changes
-----------------------------------------
- For C++20 modules, the Reduced BMI mode will be the default option. This may introduce
  regressions if your build system supports two-phase compilation model but haven't support
  reduced BMI or it is a compiler bug or a bug in users code.

- Clang now correctly diagnoses during constant expression evaluation undefined behavior due to member
  pointer access to a member which is not a direct or indirect member of the most-derived object
  of the accessed object but is instead located directly in a sibling class to one of the classes
  along the inheritance hierarchy of the most-derived object as ill-formed.
  Other scenarios in which the member is not member of the most derived object were already
  diagnosed previously. (#GH150709)

  .. code-block:: c++

    struct A {};
    struct B : A {};
    struct C : A { constexpr int foo() const { return 1; } };
    constexpr A a;
    constexpr B b;
    constexpr C c;
    constexpr auto mp = static_cast<int(A::*)() const>(&C::foo);
    static_assert((a.*mp)() == 1); // continues to be rejected
    static_assert((b.*mp)() == 1); // newly rejected
    static_assert((c.*mp)() == 1); // accepted

ABI Changes in This Version
---------------------------

AST Dumping Potentially Breaking Changes
----------------------------------------
- How nested name specifiers are dumped and printed changes, keeping track of clang AST changes.

Clang Frontend Potentially Breaking Changes
-------------------------------------------

Clang Python Bindings Potentially Breaking Changes
--------------------------------------------------
- TypeKind ``ELABORATED`` is not used anymore, per clang AST changes removing
  ElaboratedTypes. The value becomes unused, and all the existing users should
  expect the former underlying type to be reported instead.

What's New in Clang |release|?
==============================

C++ Language Changes
--------------------

C++2c Feature Support
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

C++23 Feature Support
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

C++20 Feature Support
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

C++17 Feature Support
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Resolutions to C++ Defect Reports
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

C Language Changes
------------------

C2y Feature Support
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

C23 Feature Support
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Non-comprehensive list of changes in this release
-------------------------------------------------
- Added ``__builtin_elementwise_fshl`` and ``__builtin_elementwise_fshr``.

- Added ``__builtin_elementwise_minnumnum`` and ``__builtin_elementwise_maxnumnum``.

- Trapping UBSan (e.g. ``-fsanitize-trap=undefined``) now emits a string describing the reason for
  trapping into the generated debug info. This feature allows debuggers (e.g. LLDB) to display
  the reason for trapping if the trap is reached. The string is currently encoded in the debug
  info as an artificial frame that claims to be inlined at the trap location. The function used
  for the artificial frame is an artificial function whose name encodes the reason for trapping.
  The encoding used is currently the same as ``__builtin_verbose_trap`` but might change in the future.
  This feature is enabled by default but can be disabled by compiling with
  ``-fno-sanitize-annotate-debug-info-traps``.

- ``__builtin_elementwise_max`` and ``__builtin_elementwise_min`` functions for integer types can
  now be used in constant expressions.

New Compiler Flags
------------------
- New option ``-fno-sanitize-annotate-debug-info-traps`` added to disable emitting trap reasons into the debug info when compiling with trapping UBSan (e.g. ``-fsanitize-trap=undefined``).

Deprecated Compiler Flags
-------------------------

Modified Compiler Flags
-----------------------

Removed Compiler Flags
-------------------------

Attribute Changes in Clang
--------------------------

Improvements to Clang's diagnostics
-----------------------------------
- Added a separate diagnostic group ``-Wfunction-effect-redeclarations``, for the more pedantic
  diagnostics for function effects (``[[clang::nonblocking]]`` and ``[[clang::nonallocating]]``).
  Moved the warning for a missing (though implied) attribute on a redeclaration into this group.
  Added a new warning in this group for the case where the attribute is missing/implicit on
  an override of a virtual method.
- Fixed fix-it hint for fold expressions. Clang now correctly places the suggested right
  parenthesis when diagnosing malformed fold expressions. (#GH151787)

Improvements to Clang's time-trace
----------------------------------

Improvements to Coverage Mapping
--------------------------------

Bug Fixes in This Version
-------------------------
- Fix a crash when marco name is empty in ``#pragma push_macro("")`` or
  ``#pragma pop_macro("")``. (#GH149762).
- `-Wunreachable-code`` now diagnoses tautological or contradictory
  comparisons such as ``x != 0 || x != 1.0`` and ``x == 0 && x == 1.0`` on
  targets that treat ``_Float16``/``__fp16`` as native scalar types. Previously
  the warning was silently lost because the operands differed only by an implicit
  cast chain. (#GH149967).

Bug Fixes to Compiler Builtins
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- Fix an ambiguous reference to the builtin `type_info` (available when using
  `-fms-compatibility`) with modules. (#GH38400)

Bug Fixes to Attribute Support
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- ``[[nodiscard]]`` is now respected on Objective-C and Objective-C++ methods.
  (#GH141504)
- Using ``[[gnu::cleanup(some_func)]]`` where some_func is annotated with
  ``[[gnu::error("some error")]]`` now correctly triggers an error. (#GH146520)

Bug Fixes to C++ Support
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- Diagnose binding a reference to ``*nullptr`` during constant evaluation. (#GH48665)
- Suppress ``-Wdeprecated-declarations`` in implicitly generated functions. (#GH147293)
- Fix a crash when deleting a pointer to an incomplete array (#GH150359).
- Fix an assertion failure when expression in assumption attribute
  (``[[assume(expr)]]``) creates temporary objects.
- Fix the dynamic_cast to final class optimization to correctly handle
  casts that are guaranteed to fail (#GH137518).
- Fix bug rejecting partial specialization of variable templates with auto NTTPs (#GH118190).

Bug Fixes to AST Handling
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- Fix incorrect name qualifiers applied to alias CTAD. (#GH136624)
- Fixed ElaboratedTypes appearing within NestedNameSpecifier, which was not a
  legal representation. This is fixed because ElaboratedTypes don't exist anymore. (#GH43179) (#GH68670) (#GH92757)

Miscellaneous Bug Fixes

  be computed from `-mcpu` or the platform default.

Crash and bug fixes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- Fixed a crash in the static analyzer that when the expression in an
  ``[[assume(expr)]]`` attribute was enclosed in parentheses.  (#GH151529)
