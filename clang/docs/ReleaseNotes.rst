Introduction
============

This document contains the release notes for the Clang C/C++/Objective-C
frontend, part of the LLVM Compiler Infrastructure, release |release|. Here we
describe the status of Clang in some detail, including major
improvements from the previous release and new feature work. For the
general LLVM release notes, see `the LLVM
documentation <https://llvm.org/docs/ReleaseNotes.html>`_. For the libc++ release notes,
see `this page <https://libcxx.llvm.org/ReleaseNotes.html>`_. All LLVM releases
may be downloaded from the `LLVM releases web site <https://llvm.org/releases/>`_.

For more information about Clang or LLVM, including information about the
latest release, please see the `Clang Web Site <https://clang.llvm.org>`_ or the
`LLVM Web Site <https://llvm.org>`_.

Potentially Breaking Changes
============================

- Clang will now emit a warning if the auto-detected GCC installation
  directory (i.e. the one with the largest version number) does not
  contain libstdc++ include directories although a "complete" GCC
  installation directory containing the include directories is
  available. It is planned to change the auto-detection to prefer the
  "complete" directory in the future.  The warning will disappear if
  the libstdc++ include directories are either installed or removed
  for all GCC installation directories considered by the
  auto-detection; see the output of ``clang -v`` for a list of those
  directories. If the GCC installations cannot be modified and
  maintaining the current choice of the auto-detection is desired, the
  GCC installation directory can be selected explicitly using the
  ``--gcc-install-dir`` command line argument. This will silence the
  warning. It can also be disabled using the
  ``-Wno-gcc-install-dir-libstdcxx`` command line flag.

C/C++ Language Potentially Breaking Changes
-------------------------------------------

- The ``__has_builtin`` function now only considers the currently active target when being used with target offloading.

C++ Specific Potentially Breaking Changes
-----------------------------------------
- For C++20 modules, the Reduced BMI mode will be the default option. This may introduce
  regressions if your build system supports two-phase compilation model but haven't support
  reduced BMI or it is a compiler bug or a bug in users code.

- Clang now correctly diagnoses during constant expression evaluation undefined behavior due to member
  pointer access to a member which is not a direct or indirect member of the most-derived object
  of the accessed object but is instead located directly in a sibling class to one of the classes
  along the inheritance hierarchy of the most-derived object as ill-formed.
  Other scenarios in which the member is not member of the most derived object were already
  diagnosed previously. (#GH150709)

  .. code-block:: c++

    struct A {};
    struct B : A {};
    struct C : A { constexpr int foo() const { return 1; } };
    constexpr A a;
    constexpr B b;
    constexpr C c;
    constexpr auto mp = static_cast<int(A::*)() const>(&C::foo);
    static_assert((a.*mp)() == 1); // continues to be rejected
    static_assert((b.*mp)() == 1); // newly rejected
    static_assert((c.*mp)() == 1); // accepted

ABI Changes in This Version
---------------------------

AST Dumping Potentially Breaking Changes
----------------------------------------
- How nested name specifiers are dumped and printed changes, keeping track of clang AST changes.

Clang Frontend Potentially Breaking Changes
-------------------------------------------
- Members of anonymous unions/structs are now injected as ``IndirectFieldDecl``
  into the enclosing record even if their names conflict with other names in the
  scope. These ``IndirectFieldDecl`` are marked invalid.

Clang Python Bindings Potentially Breaking Changes
--------------------------------------------------
- TypeKind ``ELABORATED`` is not used anymore, per clang AST changes removing
  ElaboratedTypes. The value becomes unused, and all the existing users should
  expect the former underlying type to be reported instead.

What's New in Clang |release|?

C++23 Feature Support
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

C++20 Feature Support
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

C++17 Feature Support
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Resolutions to C++ Defect Reports
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

C Language Changes
------------------

C2y Feature Support
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

C23 Feature Support
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Non-comprehensive list of changes in this release
-------------------------------------------------
- Added ``__builtin_elementwise_fshl`` and ``__builtin_elementwise_fshr``.

- ``__builtin_elementwise_abs`` can now be used in constant expression.

- Added ``__builtin_elementwise_minnumnum`` and ``__builtin_elementwise_maxnumnum``.

- Trapping UBSan (e.g. ``-fsanitize-trap=undefined``) now emits a string describing the reason for
  trapping into the generated debug info. This feature allows debuggers (e.g. LLDB) to display
  the reason for trapping if the trap is reached. The string is currently encoded in the debug
  info as an artificial frame that claims to be inlined at the trap location. The function used
  for the artificial frame is an artificial function whose name encodes the reason for trapping.
  The encoding used is currently the same as ``__builtin_verbose_trap`` but might change in the future.
  This feature is enabled by default but can be disabled by compiling with
  ``-fno-sanitize-annotate-debug-info-traps``.

- ``__builtin_elementwise_max`` and ``__builtin_elementwise_min`` functions for integer types can
  now be used in constant expressions.

- A vector of booleans is now a valid condition for the ternary ``?:`` operator.
  This binds to a simple vector select operation.

- Added ``__builtin_masked_load`` and ``__builtin_masked_store`` for conditional
  memory loads from vectors. Binds to the LLVM intrinsic of the same name.

- Use of ``__has_feature`` to detect the ``ptrauth_qualifier`` and ``ptrauth_intrinsics``
  features has been deprecated, and is restricted to the arm64e target only. The
  correct method to check for these features is to test for the ``__PTRAUTH__``
  macro.

- Added a new builtin, ``__builtin_dedup_pack``, to remove duplicate types from a parameter pack.
  This feature is particularly useful in template metaprogramming for normalizing type lists.
  The builtin produces a new, unexpanded parameter pack that can be used in contexts like template
  argument lists or base specifiers.

  .. code-block:: c++

    template <typename...> struct TypeList;

    // The resulting type is TypeList<int, double, char>
    using MyTypeList = TypeList<__builtin_dedup_pack<int, double, int, char, double>...>;

  Currently, the use of ``__builtin_dedup_pack`` is limited to template arguments and base
  specifiers, it also must be used within a template context.


New Compiler Flags
------------------
- New option ``-fno-sanitize-annotate-debug-info-traps`` added to disable emitting trap reasons into the debug info when compiling with trapping UBSan (e.g. ``-fsanitize-trap=undefined``).

Lanai Support
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- The option ``-mcmodel={small,medium,large}`` is supported again.

Deprecated Compiler Flags
-------------------------

Modified Compiler Flags
-----------------------

Removed Compiler Flags
-------------------------

Attribute Changes in Clang
--------------------------

Improvements to Clang's diagnostics
-----------------------------------
- Added a separate diagnostic group ``-Wfunction-effect-redeclarations``, for the more pedantic
  diagnostics for function effects (``[[clang::nonblocking]]`` and ``[[clang::nonallocating]]``).
  Moved the warning for a missing (though implied) attribute on a redeclaration into this group.
  Added a new warning in this group for the case where the attribute is missing/implicit on
  an override of a virtual method.
- Fixed fix-it hint for fold expressions. Clang now correctly places the suggested right
  parenthesis when diagnosing malformed fold expressions. (#GH151787)
- Added fix-it hint for when scoped enumerations require explicit conversions for binary operations. (#GH24265)

- Fixed an issue where emitted format-signedness diagnostics were not associated with an appropriate
  diagnostic id. Besides being incorrect from an API standpoint, this was user visible, e.g.:
  "format specifies type 'unsigned int' but the argument has type 'int' [-Wformat]"
  "signedness of format specifier 'u' is incompatible with 'c' [-Wformat]"
  This was misleading, because even though -Wformat is required in order to emit the diagnostics,
  the warning flag the user needs to concerned with here is -Wformat-signedness, which is also
  required and is not enabled by default. With the change you'll now see:
  "format specifies type 'unsigned int' but the argument has type 'int', which differs in signedness [-Wformat-signedness]"
  "signedness of format specifier 'u' is incompatible with 'c' [-Wformat-signedness]"
  and the API-visible diagnostic id will be appropriate.
  
- Fixed false positives in ``-Waddress-of-packed-member`` diagnostics when
  potential misaligned members get processed before they can get discarded.
  (#GH144729)

- Fixed false positive in ``-Wmissing-noreturn`` diagnostic when it was requiring the usage of
  ``[[noreturn]]`` on lambdas before C++23 (#GH154493).

- Clang now diagnoses the use of ``#`` and ``##`` preprocessor tokens in
  attribute argument lists in C++ when ``-pedantic`` is enabled. The operators
  can be used in macro replacement lists with the usual preprocessor semantics,
  however, non-preprocessor use of tokens now triggers a pedantic warning in C++.
  Compilation in C mode is unchanged, and still permits these tokens to be used. (#GH147217)

- Clang now diagnoses misplaced array bounds on declarators for template
  specializations in th same way as it already did for other declarators.
  (#GH147333)

Improvements to Clang's time-trace
----------------------------------

Improvements to Coverage Mapping
--------------------------------

Bug Fixes in This Version
-------------------------
- Fix a crash when marco name is empty in ``#pragma push_macro("")`` or
  ``#pragma pop_macro("")``. (#GH149762).
- `-Wunreachable-code`` now diagnoses tautological or contradictory
  comparisons such as ``x != 0 || x != 1.0`` and ``x == 0 && x == 1.0`` on
  targets that treat ``_Float16``/``__fp16`` as native scalar types. Previously
  the warning was silently lost because the operands differed only by an implicit
  cast chain. (#GH149967).
- Fixed a crash with incompatible pointer to integer conversions in designated
  initializers involving string literals. (#GH154046)
- Fixed scope of typedefs present inside a template class. (#GH91451)

Bug Fixes to Compiler Builtins
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- Fix an ambiguous reference to the builtin `type_info` (available when using
  `-fms-compatibility`) with modules. (#GH38400)

Bug Fixes to Attribute Support
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- ``[[nodiscard]]`` is now respected on Objective-C and Objective-C++ methods
  (#GH141504) and on types returned from indirect calls (#GH142453).
- Fixes some late parsed attributes, when applied to function definitions, not being parsed
  in function try blocks, and some situations where parsing of the function body
  is skipped, such as error recovery and code completion. (#GH153551)
- Using ``[[gnu::cleanup(some_func)]]`` where some_func is annotated with
  ``[[gnu::error("some error")]]`` now correctly triggers an error. (#GH146520)

Bug Fixes to C++ Support
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- Diagnose binding a reference to ``*nullptr`` during constant evaluation. (#GH48665)
- Suppress ``-Wdeprecated-declarations`` in implicitly generated functions. (#GH147293)
- Fix a crash when deleting a pointer to an incomplete array (#GH150359).
- Fixed a mismatched lambda scope bug when propagating up ``consteval`` within nested lambdas. (#GH145776)
- Fix an assertion failure when expression in assumption attribute
  (``[[assume(expr)]]``) creates temporary objects.
- Fix the dynamic_cast to final class optimization to correctly handle
  casts that are guaranteed to fail (#GH137518).
- Fix bug rejecting partial specialization of variable templates with auto NTTPs (#GH118190).
- Fix a crash if errors "member of anonymous [...] redeclares" and
  "intializing multiple members of union" coincide (#GH149985).
- Fix a crash when using ``explicit(bool)`` in pre-C++11 language modes. (#GH152729)
- Fix the parsing of variadic member functions when the ellipis immediately follows a default argument.(#GH153445)
- Fixed a bug that caused ``this`` captured by value in a lambda with a dependent explicit object parameter to not be
  instantiated properly. (#GH154054)

Bug Fixes to AST Handling
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- Fix incorrect name qualifiers applied to alias CTAD. (#GH136624)
- Fixed ElaboratedTypes appearing within NestedNameSpecifier, which was not a
  legal representation. This is fixed because ElaboratedTypes don't exist anymore. (#GH43179) (#GH68670) (#GH92757)
- Fix unrecognized html tag causing undesirable comment lexing (#GH152944)
- Fix comment lexing of special command names (#GH152943)

X86 Support
^^^^^^^^^^^
- More SSE, AVX and AVX512 intrinsics, including initializers and general
  arithmetic can now be used in C++ constant expressions.
- Some SSE, AVX and AVX512 intrinsics have been converted to wrap
  generic __builtin intrinsics.
