    Perform canonicalizations on CIR and removes some redundant operations.

    This pass performs basic cleanup and canonicalization transformations that
    are not intended to affect CIR-to-source fidelity and high-level code
    analysis passes. Example transformations performed in this pass include
    empty scope cleanup, trivial `try` cleanup, redundant branch cleanup, etc.
    Those more "heavyweight" transformations and those transformations that
    could significantly affect CIR-to-source fidelity are performed in the
    `cir-simplify` pass.

    This pass transforms CIR by inlining all the nested regions. Thus,
    the following conditions are true after the pass applied:
    - there are no nested regions in any function body
    - all the blocks in a function belong to the parent region
    In other words, this pass removes such CIR operations like IfOp, LoopOp,
    ScopeOp and etc. and produces a flat CIR.
